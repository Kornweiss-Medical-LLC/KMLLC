# Recording Weight and Waist Circumference

**Weight**
- Weigh yourself at the same time each morning with an empty bladder.
- Record your weight manually to Cronometer, an excel sheet, or write it down.
- It’s also possible to buy a connected scale (I prefer *[Withings Body+](https://www.withings.com/us/en/body-plus)*), which will send your weight to your smartphone. You can share data with me via the *Withings* app, or you can connect to Apple Health, which in turn can be linked to Cronometer. This may take a few minutes to set up, but once set, all you’ll need to do is step on the scale and I’ll be able to monitor your weight via *Withings*, Apple Health, and/or Cronometer.

**Waist Circumference**
- Use a [tape measure](https://amzn.to/3dmrqzv) designed for anthropometry.
- Measure yourself while standing up straight in a relaxed position.
- Wrap the tape measure around your abdomen, drawing a line through the umbilicus (belly button).
- Breathe in gently, and measure on the exhalation.
- The tape should be flush against the skin without causing a depression.
- Measure three times to ensure an accurate measurement. If the three are slightly different from one another, take the average of the three.
- Record this in Cronometer.
