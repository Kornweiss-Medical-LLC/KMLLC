# What happens when you lose thirty pounds?

In a [previous case report](https://kornweissmedical.com/case-report-fha/), I showed you what happens when someone who is underweight gains 20-30 pounds.

In this case report, I'll show you what happens to inflammatory markers, glycemic control, when someone who is overweight loses 20-30 pounds.

This is a case of a 31 year old female who came to me with only minor health issues. She suffered from a mild case of plantar fasciitis, and wrist tendonitis, both associated with her work which involves standing and using her hands for most of the day.

Besides these two complaints, she considered herself to be healthy. She did express a strong desire to lose weight for the purpose of improving her long-term health, and also to look and feel better.

When we started working together, she weighed 194 pounds at a height of five feet and three inches. We discussed obtaining formal measurement of body fat using either a DEXA scan or BodPod, but ultimately, this was not done. Despite her excess weight, her blood pressure was 119/88 with a resting heart rate of 72.

Her nutrition practices were to eat and drink without restriction. This was her practice for years prior to our partnership. For exercise, she would engage in occasional recreational walking, hiking, and kayaking, as well as some manual labor on her own property.

To establish a baseline of metabolic health, we conducted a laboratory analysis which included CBC, CMP, Urinalysis, Liver Function Tests, Lipid Panel with Direct LDL and Cardiac, or High-sensitivity CRP, Hemoglobin A1C and a fasting insulin level.

### Initial Laboratory Analysis

| Analyte | Result |
|:--|:--|
| Fasting Glucose  | 93 mg/dl |
| Hemoglobin A1c | 5.5% |
| Fasting Insulin | 15 microIU/mL |
| Cardiac or HS CRP | 5.1 mg/L  |
| ALT | 26 IU/L  |
| HDL-C | 39 mg/dl  |

Interpretation of labs:
A fasting glucose of 93, although considered normal by the lab, is higher than what you might expect for someone in excellent metabolic health. Instead, you would prefer to see this in the eighties at most. 

Hemoglobin A1C is a measurement of red blood cell glycation which represents roughly a three-month running average of blood glucose levels. An A1c of 5.5% corresponds to an average blood glucose of 111. This is considered normal. Most labs consider 5.7% to be the cutoff for “pre-diabetes,” and 6.5% to be the cutoff for diabetes. However, physiology is not discrete, it’s continuous. Longevity experts agree that lower average blood glucose levels are likely beneficial. I’ve seen A1c’s as low as 4.5% and as high as 15%. 4.5% is hard to achieve for most people. I suggest 5% as a target for people in whom I believe the measurement is accurate (there are several reasons that your A1c might not accurately reflect your average blood glucose).

Fasting insulin is a reflection of your basal insulin level. The less insulin that you require to achieve a certain glucose level in the fasting state, the more insulin sensitive you are. The more insulin sensitive you are, the better. An excellent fasting insulin might be 4 or 5 microIU/mL with a fasting blood glucose of 70-80. In this case, my client has a fasting insulin of 15.

CRP or C-reactive protein is a protein which increases in the blood stream in response to any sort of inflammation or infection. It’s sometimes used as a marker of cardiovascular and metabolic health. In the absence of other acute medical problems, an elevated CRP suggests systemic inflammation as a result of poor metabolic health. My client’s CRP was mildly elevated.

ALT (alanine aminotransferase) is an enzyme found primarily within liver cells. In people with hepatic steatosis (fatty-liver), ALT will often be elevated. Normal is usually considered to be less than 40, but 20 is probably a healthier cutoff. People with excellent metabolic health often have blood ALT levels far below this. My patient’s initial ALT was 26, suggesting (although not proving) possible fatty-liver.

HDL-c (high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol) - this is a measurement of the amount of cholesterol trafficked as part of HDL particles. In patients with energy surplus and poor metabolic health, this number is usually lower than in patients with excellent metabolic health. Though poorly understood, most people believe HDL particles are a requisite part of reverse cholesterol transport — an important and arguably cardioprotective process. My client’s HDL-c, though not extremely low, was only 39. This needs to be interpreted within the context of the rest of the lipid panel, which I’ve not pictured nor discussed here.

Overall, I believe my clients initial blood work represented suboptimal metabolic health. I explained to her that an improvement in nutrition and energy balance would likely improve all of these markers, and as a result decrease the risk of chronic disease like cancer, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and dementia. 

In addition to the lab analysis, we also conducted a baseline analysis of her nutrition. We used [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/) to [track](https://kornweissmedical.com/recording-nutrition-in-cronometer/) her daily diet for two weeks before making any changes.

### Sample Daily Diet

### Initial Nutrition Analysis

/Screen Shot 2021-03-28 at 11.50.46 AM.png

You can see net carbohydrate consumption on the sample-day was nearly 250 grams, protein 68 grams, and fat 50 grams. During the first week of tracking, average energy intake was 2125 kcal, carbohydrate intake was nearly 200 grams daily, and fat over 90 grams daily. Protein intake was 91 grams daily.

Based on estimates of BMR, my client was in a net daily energy surplus.

There has been a lot of debate recently about whether weight loss is as simple as calories-in versus calories-out. The short answer is yes, it is this simple. But, the longer answer is more complex because of the following factors:

- The thermogenic effect of food
- Fuel partitioning
- The psychomotor effects of different foods and macronutrients
- The satiety effect of different foods and macronutrients

To summarize these effects, I would say that foods and meals that are comprised of only a single macronutrient, especially if that macro is fat or protein are more satiating and will usually result in less total calories consumed, all other things being equal. What’s more, foods with low or moderate reward value, which are usually less complex in terms of flavor profile, and contain only one or two of the major macronutrients, will also be more satiating. Paradoxically, in overweight or obese people, a decrease in intake, and a decrease in mixed fat-carbohydrate meals usually results in increased satiety and increased desire to exercise.

As a result - nearly any diet that focuses on eliminating or drastically reducing one or two of the major macronutrients will result in weight loss as satiety improves and exercise increases.

This is why all of the following diets work for weight-loss in comparison to a “standard American diet” which specifies no restrictions on total calories, macronutrients, types of foods, or timing of eating:
- Ketogenic diet - emphasizes fat and minimizes carbohydrate and protein
- Vegetarian whole-food diet - drastically minimizes all macronutrients, and depending on how its formulated can emphasize any of the three
	- e.g. if heavy in nuts salad with oils like olive-oil it will emphasize fat
	- e.g. if heavy in beans and lentils will emphasize protein
- Atkins diet - emphasizes protein, can minimize fat, and drastically reduces carbohydrates
- Low-fat Diet - emphasizes protein and carbohydrate, minimizes fat
- Various fasting diets - Time-restricted feeding, intermittent fasting, one-meal-a-day, and the fasting mimicking diet — all reduce the times during which energy can be consumed and thus usually end up capping all macronutrients

In people with signs of glucose intolerance, a low-carbohydrate diet is extremely effective at eliminating cravings, improving satiety, and producing results in terms of weight-loss and overall feeling of well-being. There are many ways to formulate a low-carbohydrate diet. I prefer not to focus on “diets”, but rather to teach my clients about nutrition using broad concepts so that they can eventually formulate their own nutrition plan and adapt to future needs. Each of the diets above represents an underlying nutrition concept and corresponding tool that can be used by different people for different reasons at different times.

Here is what I wrote to my client:

> 1. Reduce carbohydrate intake to less than 75g per day. We will try this for two weeks and then reassess. Later on we can go lower if this goes well. Eat as much protein and fat as you want until you feel full.

> **Explanation:**
> Your daily intake of carbs is currently around 150g/day.
> 
> For the first week, let’s reduce this to 75 grams - If you get up to 100g on some days that is okay.
> 
> Be generous with yourself and allow for mistakes and deviations - this is difficult and will take time to achieve.
> 
> Your fat intake is hovering around 60g/day. This can be increased to at least 110 grams if needed to allow you to feel satiated (full) while reducing carbohydrate intake.
> 
> Your protein intake has been around 80 grams. This can be reduced to 68 grams, but is less important to worry about at the moment.

**Commentary**: In retrospect, I wish I’d left out the advice regarding protein intake. Higher protein intake is likely to improve satiety and unlikely to contribute to weight gain or to prevent weight loss.

Continuation of the message to my client:

> The reasons for these changes are:
> i) By reducing carbohydrate intake, you’ll improve your insulin sensitivity, decrease processed food consumption, decrease the reward-value of your diet, decrease cravings, decrease energy intake, and as a result, lose weight.
> ii) By tracking macronutrients, you’ll think carefully about your food choices which decreases mindless eating and teaches the nutritional value of different foods. 
> iii) When you become more conscious of your nutrition choices, it’s easier to choose foods that you know contribute towards your long-term health versus those that detract from it.
> 
> 2. Eliminate processed foods and artificial sweeteners and eat real whole foods instead. We can discuss options if you find this difficult. 
> 
> **Explanation:**
> Many processed foods are often addicting. A few small snacks can add up to a lot of calories and make you reliant on rewarding flavor combinations of sugar, fat, salt, and carbs. Processing makes them highly available to the bloodstream without using any energy to digest or absorb the components you are eating. Eating whole foods instead will make a big difference in your feeling of fullness and will cause a natural decrease in energy intake. You’ll probably notice that you just feel better overall and that your digestion is improved too.
> 
> Based on your tracking, here are some suggestions of processed foods to avoid:
> 
> Coffee creamer, CBD fruit chew, granola bars, breads/wraps unless truly home-made with real high-quality ingredients, nut-butters that have added oils/sugars, spreads/sauces that have added sugars/syrups/oils, fruit juices, sodas, simple grains (white breads, pastas), baked goods, fruit spreads.
> 
> Replace those processed foods with:
> 
> Vegetables, meats, fish, nuts (especially walnuts, almonds, macadamia), seeds, full-fat dairy (real cheese, whole milk, sour cream, full-fat unsweetened yogurt), oils (olive oil) in very small amounts, and some fruit.
> 
> Carbohydrates that you can include in your diet:
> 
> Potatoes and other root vegetables, berries, full-fat dairy, small quantities of nuts.

These instructions were sent and then discussed in person to make sure the plan was clear. This can be a lot of information to take in for someone who is new to nutrition plans. Even after the initial discussion, we would often communicate by text every day or two. I answered questions about specific foods. I also left comments on my client’s electronic nutrition diary.

After two weeks of this intervention, my client lost six pounds. Following these broad instructions alone, she lost a total of seventeen pounds in three months.

Exercise during this time period was sporadic and mostly recreational. We did work on implementing a 3-5x per week regimen of 5-15 minutes of air squats, kettle bell deadlifts, and modified push-ups. She also engaged in recreational activities like walking, hiking, and kayaking once or twice per week.

Repeat labs after three months revealed that her high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, a sensitive but non-specific marker of inflammation was cut in half from 5.1 to 2.6.

Her plantar fasciitis and wrist pain resolved. She reported feeling drastically better in terms of overall energy and mood.

By November, her weight was down to 165 pounds. We lost contact for several months as her schedule became quite busy, but in January we reconvened to repeat labs. Her weight was stable at 164 pounds.

By this time, HgbA1C was down from 5.5% to 5.1%, HDL rose from 39 to 55, and hs-CRP was now normal at 1.22, down from 2.6 in September of the previous year, and down from an initial measurement of 5.1. ALT was down to 11 from a starting point of 26.

In the following months, we made adjustments to macronutrient intake, experimented with time-restricted feeding and intermittent fasting, and improved her exercise program.

In my practice, we typically check labs roughly every six months as a matter of routine, but more frequently if needed. Our next lab check was done 15 months after our starting point. My client's weight was down to 160 pounds and has stabilized. Our nutrition interventions have become regular eating habits. Her weight continues to come down despite waxing and waning exercise.

At a weight of 160 pounds, labs revealed an A1C of 5.2, HDL-C of 54, and an ALT of 9, all of which are stable or improved. Hs-CRP was not rechecked this time, but it will be on our next check.

Here is a six-month graph of my client’s weight against a running average of energy consumption.

You can see how A1c, ALT, and CRP all came down while HDL went up as nutrition improved and excess fat was lost.

Not pictured here is fasting insulin which came down to 11 from 15, and fasting triglycerides which came down from 166 to 88 and Vitamin D which is up to 37 from 24.

Overall, a gradual stepwise approach of reducing energy dense and processed foods in favor of a nutrient dense whole food diet, adhered to roughly 80-90% of the time, combined with minimal exercise and recreation resulted in a 35 pound weight loss over a 16 month time period. During this time, my client's metabolic profile improved significantly. Coinciding with these improvements was a resolution of plantar fasciitis, joint pain, and low energy. In their place was an increase in energy, an improvement in mood, a sense of self-control and nutrition knowledge that was lacking before.

All put together, this journey was more than mere weight loss. It was a remarkable improvement in health and a renewed sense of self-esteem.

What's more, because the approach was one of education rather than dogmatization or indoctrination, my client is now teaching others - her family and friends - how to do the same. She is able to control her own health without relying on a specific “fad diet.” She has knowledge and tools that she can employ to continue to improve her health.
