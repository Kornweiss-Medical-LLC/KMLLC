## 6 - Begin Tracking Your Nutrition

[Nutrition Tracking Instructions](./nutrition_tracking_instructions.md)

## 7 - Record and Track Your Weight and Waist Circumference

**Weight**
- Buy a connected smart-scale (I prefer *[Withings Body+](https://www.withings.com/us/en/body-plus)*, which will send your weight to the Withings App, which can be connected to Apple Health and/or Cronometer.
- OR use a non-smart-scale and record weights in Cronometer manually.
- Weigh yourself at the same time each morning after emptying your bladder.

**Waist Circumference**
- Use a [tape measure](https://amzn.to/3dmrqzv) designed for anthropometry.
- Measure yourself while standing up straight in a relaxed position.
- Measure on a line that intersects your umbilicus (belly button).
- Breathe in gently, and then measure on the exhalation.
- The tape should be flush against the skin, but not so tight that it causes a depression.
- Measure three times to ensure an accurate measurement. If the three are slightly different from one another, take the average of the three.
- Record this number in Cronometer.

## 9 - Laboratory Testing

You’ll receive a lab order by email along with instructions. We typically use Labcorp, Boston Heart, or Quest. Please review your order and the included instructions.

Here are some key lab instructions to be aware of for future reference:

**Women - Hormone Labs**

For hormone testing, it’s important to test 7 days after ovulation, which means on average, day 21 of the menstrual cycle. This is the timing required to measure peak progesterone levels.

It’s common for individuals to have shorter or longer cycles and differing lengths of follicular and luteal phases. Therefore, it helps to track your menstrual cycle using basal body temperature and/or by learning [how to check cervical mucous](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/fertility-awareness/whats-cervical-mucus-method-fams) in order to get the timing right.

Perhaps the easiest way to track your menstrual cycle is by using the [ŌURA ring + Natural Cycles](https://www.naturalcycles.com/oura?campaignid=18571382315&adgroupid=145079492849&utm_content=627436183347_&utm_campaign=&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&gclid=CjwKCAiA2rOeBhAsEiwA2Pl7Q2P4K-BnKHmKeVcxRamPZOxC0Rcknvl6jQd2lPf1OIe58vekXWlqNRoCqaIQAvD_BwE).

Whichever way you track, the goal is to detect the day of ovulation and to have labs drawn 7 days after ovulation.

**Men - Hormone Labs**

Schedule your lab draw between 7am and 9am in order to have the highest chance of obtaining accurate measurements of testosterone.

**Men and Women**

*Fasting*
- Fast for at least 13 hours prior to your lab draw. Water only. Do not drink black coffee, as it can cause an elevation of triglycerides in some individuals.

*Diet, Medications, Supplements*
- Maintain a stable diet, supplementation regimen, and medication regimen for at least 3 weeks leading up to lab draws in order for the results to accurately reflect your current regimen.

*Biotin*
- Stop taking any supplement containing biotin at least 72 hours prior to the lab draw, especially if taking >= 100 mg/day. (*[Source](https://www.aacc.org/science-and-research/aacc-academy-guidance/biotin-interference-in-laboratory-tests)*)
