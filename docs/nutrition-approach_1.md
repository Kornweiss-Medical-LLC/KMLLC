## Nutrition Framework

Overview:
   - Set a goal
   - Determine metrics
   - Assess the current situation
   - Remove contradictions
   - Add essentials
   - Execute new plan
   - Reassess
   - Repeat

# Filling in the Framework
   
## Goals and Metrics

First, I write down an explicit goal such as, "I want to lose 5 pounds." Or, a much broader goal, such as, "I want to live as long as possible, but I also want to look and feel strong, energetic, and lean." For a narrow goal, like the first one, I might only track weight. For a broader goal, like the second one, I might need to establish a longer list of metrics to track my progress (e.g. weight, body fat %, subjective energy level, exercise capacity, hba1c%, lipids, etc.).

In reality, I don't have just one goal at a time, but I do work on one goal at a time. What I have is a hierarchy of goals that is ruled by a broad goal, but is executed in terms of simpler goals like the first one above.

## Assessment
After my goal is established, I evaluate my current nutrition status by tracking everything I eat and drink for a minimum of 1 week (not as hard as it sounds - I will demonstrate how to do this simply in a later post. To avoid appearing enigmatic here, the basic approach is to use an app called Cronometer).

## Identify and Remove Contradictions

Next, I evaluate which parts of my current nutrition contradict my goal. If my goal is to lose weight, the obvious contradiction would be any food that provides excess energy intake - i.e. too many calories.

So, in this instance, my intervention would be to eliminate any food that is a source of excess energy but which is not essential to my other nutrition needs - i.e. vitamins, minerals, essential fats, amino acids, etc.

## Add Essentials

I add necessities that were missing (e.g. sources of calcium, vitamin A, C, D, choline, etc.) without adding back any excess energy. The best way to do this is usually to use nutrient dense, energy poor foods. I'll discuss this in more detail in a later post - but examples of nutrient-dense energy-poor foods are non-root vegetables such as green leaves, peppers, crucifers, fish, lean meat, eggs, and organ meats.

## Execute New Plan

Lastly, I track *everything* I consume until I learn how to eat my new plan without tracking.

## Reassess and Repeat

I follow metrics for a predetermined time frame and then reassess the original goal and my progress towards that goal. The time frame needs to be long enough to see the relationship between cause and effect; that is, between intervention and results. The time frame should be short enough to maintain motivation and to make quick improvements. In the case of losing 5 pounds, this is reasonably achievable in 2-6 weeks, so this interval would be a good reassessment time period.

Once the reassessment is done - repeat the whole process, including adjusting the goal if needed.

In my next post, I'll break down more details and explain how to execute the above plan with specific examples.
