[Dr. Marta Long](https://www.martalongmd.com/) - Irvine, $400/mo
- Graduated from Yale Medical School in 2003 and Yale Internal Medicine Residency in 2006. She worked for 6 years as an internal medicine physician in Virginia, then as Clinic Director for Sea Mar Community Health Centers in Seattle for 1 year, and then for Kaiser for another year. After this, she took a nearly 4 year sabbatical to care for family and to do volunteer work. Roughly 2 years ago she opened her private practice in Irvine.
- Dr. Long's practice is a "mobile modern medicine" practice. She performs house calls. She also has an office and believes in private and attentive care. She's available 24/7 by phone and offers video consultations. She offers IV therapies, acupuncture, and in-house phlebotomy.
- Her services include home xrays, home ultrasound, immunizations, nutrition and fitness assessments, and customized wellness plans. I believe the home imaging and blood draw services have additional associated fees.
- She seems very professional in my correspondence with her and is willing to collaborate with me on your care should you choose to work with both of us. She also has hospital privileges at Hoag Hospital and Providence Mission hospital.

[Hoag Concierge Care](https://hoagconciergemedicine.com/membership/) - Newport Beach, $425-650/mo
- You may be familiar Hoag Hospital and health system. Hoag concierge is their private medical practice. They appear to have a very nice facility which includes fitness facilities and an exercise physiology lab. They employ a multi-disciplinary team including nutritionists, exercise physiologists, and physicians.
- The signature membership whicch costs $425/mo includes 24 access to your physician, a designated care team (physician, nursing staff, fitness and nutrition personnel), annual fitness and nutrition assessment, full gym access, same-day appointments, in-office labs, coordination of care, and an online portal.
- This looks like a very good option in terms of value. The only downside I'm aware of is that they seem to employ physicians with below-average training backgrounds. Two of the four physicians graduated from Caribbean medical schools. The other two graduated from good schools. They all have average residency training. This does not mean they aren't stellar and particularly intelligent physicians, it just decreases the liklihood a little bit.

[MD2](https://www.md2.com/offices/santa-monica-ca) - Santa Monica, $2000/mo
- This practice is a premier concierge practice. Each physician accepts a maximum of 50 families under their care. They have an established relationship with top specialists and medical institutions.
- Their fee is high but it includes all services in their office: physical exams, lab tests, xrays, and certain medications. They also perform house calls.
- They have two physicians - Dr. Peter Lefevre and Dr. Michael Estes. Peter graduated AOA Honors from USC and has a BS in biology from Berkeley. He did his residency training at Keck School of Medicine at USC. He's an associate professor at UCLA school of medicine and he's been working for MD2 for almost 2 years. Estes has a BS from Boston college in biology, masters from Georgetown in Physiology and applied biophysics, and his MD from Georgetown. He's also an assistant clinical professor at UCLA and has been with MD2 for almost 2 years. These guys are well trained and have a lot of experience. 

[Private Medical](https://privatemedical.org/executive-summary/) - Beverly Hills or Santa Monica, $40,000/year
- I learned of this practice from one of the physicians who works for Peter Attia. She used to work for Private Medical and has only good things to say about it. They have an opening with a female physician in August - I don't know who the physician is.
- This practice is a privately held practice with offices in NY, LA, SF, and silicon valley. Their staff is trained by Forbes Travel Guide Five-Star service methodology.
- Members receive a data-driven, personalized Medical Annual report with a strategic plan of appointments, testing, and procedures for the upcoming year. They provide all of the administrative support to efficiently implement the plan.
- They proactively manage all aspects of health including illness prevention, diagnosis, treatment, recovery, as well as urgent and emergent concerns, locally and around the world.
- They have a network of preferred relationships with physicians and medical centers in more than 200 cities globally. They provide members with worldwide medical jet evacuation service and a personalized medical pharmacy for home or travel.
- If you can afford this practice, it seems like the most elite option in your area.

[Go Forward](https://goforward.com/locations/ca/los-angeles-santa-monica) - Santa Monica, $100-$150/mo
- This is a startup with offices all around the country. They use technology and AI to monitor your labs and biometrics. They also use genetics in their approach to long-term health.
- This is a very interesting concept to me and if you choose it, I'd be very curious to hear how they perform, because they've been advertising aggressively for a couple years.
- The Santa Monica Office has two physicians - the first one trained at Birmingham and George Washington, the second at Dartmouth and UCLA. They both look like young phyicians.
- They're accessible 24/7 by text and they have virtual visits.

[Halcyon Health](http://www.halcyonhealthdpc.com/dpc-philosophy) - Irvine, $100/mo
- This is a privately held practice that follows the direct primary care model that was pioneered by Josh Umbehr, who you might know. Their prices are lower than all of these other concierge practices. They don't currently have any openings, but I've enquired about their waitlist.
- DPC practices offer discounted labs, direct physician access, and are usually owned and run by the physician. The founder, owner, and physician is Dr. Scott - she trained at Mount Sinai and did an integrative fellowship with Dr. Andrew Weil. Her husband also works witht he practice. He trained at Albert Einstein. They have a third physician who trained at Harbor UCLA and also did an integrative fellowship with Weil. They're all well trained and their practice appears to be thriving and focused on high-quality integrative care.
