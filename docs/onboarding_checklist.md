## 6 - Begin Tracking Your Nutrition

[Instructions](./nutrition_tracking_instructions.md)

## 7 - Record and Track Your Weight and Waist Circumference

**Weight**
- Weigh yourself at the same time each morning with an empty bladder.
- Record your weight manually in Cronometer.
- It’s also possible to buy a connected scale (I prefer *[Withings Body+](https://www.withings.com/us/en/body-plus)*, which will send your weight to your smartphone.
- You can share data with me via the *Withings* app, or you can connect to Apple Health, which in turn can be linked to Cronometer. This may take a few minutes to set up, but once set, all you’ll need to do is step on the scale and I’ll be able to monitor your weight via *Withings*, Apple Health, and/or Cronometer.

**Waist Circumference**
- Use a [tape measure](https://amzn.to/3dmrqzv) designed for anthropometry.
- Measure yourself while standing up straight in a relaxed position.
- Wrap the tape measure around your abdomen, drawing a line through the umbilicus (belly button).
- Breathe in gently, and measure on the exhalation.
- The tape should be flush against the skin without causing a depression.
- Measure three times to ensure an accurate measurement. If the three are slightly different from one another, take the average of the three.
- Record this in Cronometer.

## 8 - Record and Track Blood Pressure

## 9 - Laboratory Testing

You’ll receive a lab order. We typically use Labcorp or Boston Heart, sometimes Quest. You’ll receive instructions in your email along with the lab order. Please review those instructions, and review these important items below:

**Women - Hormone Labs**

For hormone testing, we like to test 7 days after ovulation, which means on average, day 21 of the menstrual cycle.

However, women have shorter or longer cycles and differing lengths of follicular and luteal phases. Therefore, it helps to track your menstrual cycle using basal body temperature and/or by learning [how to check cervical mucous](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/fertility-awareness/whats-cervical-mucus-method-fams).

Perhaps the easiest way to track your menstrual cycle is by using the [ŌURA ring + Natural Cycles](https://www.naturalcycles.com/oura?campaignid=18571382315&adgroupid=145079492849&utm_content=627436183347_&utm_campaign=&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&gclid=CjwKCAiA2rOeBhAsEiwA2Pl7Q2P4K-BnKHmKeVcxRamPZOxC0Rcknvl6jQd2lPf1OIe58vekXWlqNRoCqaIQAvD_BwE).

Whichever way you track, try to have labs drawn 7 days after ovulation.

**Men - Hormone Labs**

Schedule your lab draw between 7am and 9am in order to have the highest chance of obtaining accurate measurements of testosterone.

**Men and Women**

*Fasting*
- Fast for at least 13 hours. Water only. Even black coffee can elevated triglycerides in some individuals.

*Diet, Medications, Supplements*
- Maintain a stable diet, supplementation regimen, and medication regimen for at least 3 weeks leading up to labs in order for lab work to accurately reflect your current regimen.

*Biotin*
- Stop any supplement containing biotin for at least 72 hours prior to the lab draw, especially if taking >= 100 mg/day. (*[Source](https://www.aacc.org/science-and-research/aacc-academy-guidance/biotin-interference-in-laboratory-tests)*)
