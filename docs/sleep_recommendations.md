## Justice

What does justice have to do with sleep?

There are a million tips, tricks, and hacks that people have found can help with duration, depth, and sleep efficiency. Similarly, there are many behaviors that can detract from adequate sleep. But, I think, that those who sleep most soundly, are those who live most soundly. To live soundly is to live with integrity - to follow your own values with your own independent judgment. When these people get into bed at night, they judge that they are worthy of their sleep.

People who figure out what they want to do with their lives, and then they do it with complete and total focus all day, are exhausted when bedtime arrives. They get in bed knowing they pursued their values to the best of their abilities that day. They're genuinely spent - mentally and physically. As a result, they fall asleep quickly, they sleep soundly, and when it's time to get up in the morning, they can't wait to get out of bed and get back to life. They're not groggy, they're excited to get up.

In my opinion, without the conviction that you've earned your sleep, every hack in the world won't get you the restful sleep you want and need.

I do think there are a lot more details and complications than what I've said above. Of course, there are medical problems and sleep disorders that can prevent even the most purposeful and motivated individuals from sleeping well from time to time; but, I do think it's true that living the life you want to live is the biggest most important factor to sleeping well.

With that being said, here are all of the sleep hacks that I've found to be helpful:

That said, here are the things I've learned that can help improve sleep latency and efficiency:

## Timing

Having a consistent sleep schedule will establish a routine, a pattern, and habits surrounding sleeping and waking that your mind and body will grow accustomed to. I personally have difficulty with this due to the nature of my work, but when possible, I stick to a schedule.

## Preparation

Delivering bedtime cues to your subconscious can be useful. Some examples include stretching, reading, listening to a podcast or audiobook, or taking a hot shower. Just make sure the activity doesn't conflict with the other recommendations here. I usually listen to a podcast set to a 15 or 30 minute sleep timer while I'm lying in bed. Sometimes I do mobility work with a foam roller or a mobility "peanut."

## Cognitive Off-loading

If I fail to accomplish all of my daily tasks, I often lie awake thinking of everything I need to get done the next day. I worry about how long these tasks might take, or I might even get my phone or computer out and start working on things while I'm in bed. This can lead to me staying awake for an extra 1-3 hours. To avoid this, journaling in the evening and getting my task lists prepared for the next day allows my subconscious to relax.

## Light

Sleep experts recommend total darkness in the bedroom. I aim for this, but definitely have a couple very dim LEDs and some outside light that filters into the room that don't seem to bother me. I do use night shift mode on my Apple devices in the evening, which cuts the blue light out of the screen. I also dim these devices as low as they'll go after sundown. I dim my house lights to minimal brightness and use as few lights as necessary. Some people really go nuts by installing red-spectrum lights in their house and wearing blue-blocking glasses in the afternoon or evening. I've never tried this, but if you have a real problem getting to sleep, this might be worth looking into.

## Temperature

I sleep at 71 or 72 degrees in the summer on most nights, and in the winter I heat my house to around 65 degrees. I adjust my clothing until I feel comfortable. I have mixed feelings on this one - because I have found that sleeping in warmer temperatures in the summer has helped me acclimate to the heat and allows me to feel more comfortable outside in hot temperatures in the summer, whereas if I sleep at 70-72, I feel pretty uncomfortable in 98 degrees F. There is probably a good balance here that can be found on a case-by-case basis. Overall, if you're having trouble getting to sleep and you're also over-heated, cooling the house by a degree or two might be a good step to take. For those who want to spend more money, some sleep experts recommend a cooling pad such as the [Ooler](https://www.chilitechnology.com/products/ooler-sleep-system?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_Yud9pzL6gIVkZOzCh1ClQEJEAAYASAAEgLuVvD_BwE) or [chiliPAD](https://www.chilitechnology.com/products/chilipad-sleep-system) (both at Trademarks of Chili). I haven't tried either one, but they do look pretty awesome.

## Food

Try to wrap up meals at least 3 hrs before bed. If you need to eat closer to bed time, keep it down to small items; low fat and low protein. A personal favorite snack to have late at night if I'm getting hungry before bed is a cup of bone broth. It'll take away hunger and may even help with sleep. I've personally measured my blood sugar, sleep latency, heart rate, heart rate variability, and sleep disruptions after eating large mixed meals just before bedtime, and there is a big-time negative effect. My blood sugar stays elevated all night, my heart rate can run 10 beats higher than baseline, my heart rate variability plummets, and I can lose an additional 20-30 minutes over the course of the night in disruptions.

## Sound

Try to keep it quiet, and if you can't, consider an air filter, fan, or white noise machine.

## Caffeine

Some people are slow metabolizers and may still have some circulating caffeine late at night even after a single morning or midday coffee. Cut back as much as you can (I know - I love my coffee as much as the next person), but still, try to cut back on the quantity and have it as early as possible. If you can stop drinking coffee (and other sources of caffeine) by 9 or 10 am, or earlier, that is ideal. If you find yourself tired in the early afternoon the first couple days, give it a few days to see if getting more sleep makes up for the decrease in caffeine.

## Workouts

Keep high intensity workouts early in the day is a good strategy. Many people I know find that high-intensity workouts in the evening keep them up later. I often break my own rule on this one and I do usually pay the price.

## Supplements

I used to take a melatonin lozenge, phosphatidylcholine, and Doc Parsley's Sleep Remedy, but now I just take the sleep remedy which contains all 3 ingredients, and several others. Some nights I feel as though this really helps, and on others it's hard to tell the difference. Still, I think there is reason to believe that this supplement is safe and likely at least somewhat effective for many people, that it's a worthy addition if you need to get to sleep. It certainly won't knock you out, but it also won't make you feel groggy.
