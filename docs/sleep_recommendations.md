## Live Soundly, Sleep Soundly

More than anything else, I think that what you do while you're awake determines how well you'll sleep.

Those who sleep most soundly, are those who live most soundly. Living soundly means living with purpose and integrity - with values and with moral consistency.

Pursuing values is hard work. Do it all day, and you'll be tired. The more tired you are at the end of the day, the better you'll sleep.

Besides the mental and physical exhaustion, you will be able to judge yourself as having earned your rest. When you lie down in a dark quiet room, instead of your subconscious mind raising questions and criticisms, it will be quiet because it will be satisfied and at peace.

There aren't any sleep hacks, supplements, medications, or blue-blockers that will overcome a mind at war with itself.

With that said, here are all of the sleep tactics that I've found to be helpful:

## Timing

Having a consistent sleep schedule will establish a routine, a pattern, and habits surrounding sleeping and waking that your mind and body will grow accustomed to. 

I personally have difficulty with this due to the nature of my work, but when possible, I stick to a schedule.

## Preparation

Having a routine to deliver bedtime cues to your subconscious can be useful. 

Some examples include stretching, reading, listening to a podcast ([my favorite podcast](https://jockopodcast.com/)) or audiobook ([my current audiobook as of July, 2020](https://www.audible.com/pd/Grit-Audiobook/B01D3AC5BA)), or taking a hot shower. Just make sure the activity doesn't conflict with the other recommendations here. I usually listen to a podcast with the sleep timer set to 15 or 30 minutes. Sometimes I do mobility work with a foam roller or a [mobility "peanut."](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A9XPNOQ/ref=as_sl_pc_as_ss_li_til?tag=kornweissmedi-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=bc4a9cd29351079f06dea5563685d27d&creativeASIN=B00A9XPNOQ)

## Cognitive Off-loading

Try to get everything done during the day by planning and focusing. 

If I have tasks left over in the evening, I solve this problem by journaling and getting my task lists prepared for the next day. This activity allows my subconscious to relax. I was inspired to do this after reading Cal Newport's book "Deep Work." In the book, he talks about doing a ["shut down"](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2009/06/08/drastically-reduce-stress-with-a-work-shutdown-ritual/) at the end of the work day akin to shutting down your computer.

## Light

Sleep experts recommend total darkness in the bedroom. The circadian rhythm is entrained by the sun - seeing the sunrise in the morning and the sunset in the evening might be the two biggest cues to set up a reliable sleep-wake cycle.

I aim for darkness in the bedroom, but definitely have a couple very dim LEDs and some outside light that filters into the room that don't seem to bother me. I do use [night shift mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207570) on my Apple devices in the evening, which cuts the blue light out of the screen. I also dim these devices as low as they'll go after sundown. I dim my house lights to minimal brightness and use as few lights as necessary.

Some people really go all out by installing red-spectrum lights in their house and wearing blue-blocking glasses in the afternoon or evening. I've never tried this, but if you have a real problem getting to sleep, this might be worth looking into. Peter Attia, MD, one of my favorite resources on sleep, nutrition, and longevity medicine discusses this at length in multiple places on his [website](https://peterattiamd.com/category/sleep/) and [podcast](https://peterattiamd.com/ama04/). As of July, 2020, he recommends [these glasses](https://shopfelixgray.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=G_PS_Brand_Felix_Gray_Priority_B_E_P&utm_adgroup=G_PS_Brand_Felix_Gray_Priority_Brand_Name_E&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI4sf3x9fL6gIVSuDICh225wQ5EAAYASAAEgKc-vD_BwE) from a company called Felix Gray - I have not tried these myself.

## Temperature

Cooling of the core body temperature may help with sleep initiation.

I sleep at 71 or 72 degrees in the summer on most nights, and in the winter I heat my house to around 65 degrees. I adjust my clothing until I feel comfortable. I have mixed feelings on this one, because I have found that sleeping in warmer temperatures in the summer has helped me acclimatize to the heat and allows me to feel more comfortable outside in hot temperatures. If I sleep at temps consistently cooler than 72, I feel pretty uncomfortable in 98 degrees F during the day.

There is probably a good balance here that can be found on a case-by-case basis. Overall, if you're having trouble getting to sleep and you're also over-heated, cooling the house by a degree or two might be a good step to take. For those who have serious problems overheating at night and need drastically cooler temperatures than their bed-fellow, a cooling pad such as the [Ooler](https://www.chilitechnology.com/products/ooler-sleep-system?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_Yud9pzL6gIVkZOzCh1ClQEJEAAYASAAEgLuVvD_BwE) or [chiliPAD](https://www.chilitechnology.com/products/chilipad-sleep-system) (both Trademarks of Chili). I haven't yet tried either one.

## Food

Try to wrap up meals at least 3 hrs before bed. If you need to eat closer to bed time, keep it down to small items and consider eating carbohydrates rather than fat and protein. The reason for this is that it's more metabolically expensive to absorb and digest fat and protein, so eating them generates more heat ([the thermic effect of food(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_dynamic_action#Types_of_foods)]), increases the heart rate, and will leave your stomach full for a longer period of time. 

A personal favorite evening food is a cup of bone broth. It'll take away hunger and may even help with sleep due to its glycine content <sup>[1]</sup>. I've measured my own blood sugar, sleep latency, heart rate, heart rate variability, and sleep disruptions after eating large mixed meals (fat, carbohydrates, and protein) just before bedtime, and there is a major negative effect. My blood sugar stays elevated all night, my heart rate can run 10 beats higher than baseline, my heart rate variability plummets, and I can lose an additional 20-30 minutes of sleep over the course of the night in disruptions. There are several other reasons not to eat close to bedtime that are outside the scope of this article<sup>[2]</sup>.

## Sound

Try to keep it quiet, and if you can't, consider an air filter, fan, or white noise machine.

## Caffeine

Eliminate caffeine completely from your diet if possible. If you can't, consume as little as possible and as early as possible.

Some people are slow metabolizers and may still have some circulating caffeine late at night even after a single morning or midday coffee. You may not feel the effects of the caffeine, but that doesn't mean that it isn't keeping you awake. Try to cut back on the quantity and have it as early as possible. If you can stop drinking coffee (and other sources of caffeine) by 9 or 10 am, or earlier, that is ideal. If you find yourself tired in the early afternoon the first couple days, give it a few more days to see if getting more sleep makes up for the decrease in caffeine.

## Workouts

Perform high intensity workouts early in the day. Many people find that high-intensity workouts in the evening keep them up later. I sometimes break my own rule on this one and I usually pay the price.

## Supplements

If you do most of the other things properly most of the time, you probably won't need medications or supplements, almost ever. That said, sometimes you need to ensure a good night's sleep and you need some extra help. For those nights, I think [Doc Parsley's Sleep Remedy](https://store.docparsley.com/products/sleep-remedy) is safe and effective. It contains a small dose of melatonin which is meant to help with sleep initiation, serotonin, phosphatidylserine, magnesium, and vitamin D. 

I use this on rare occasions, but not as a matter of routine. Some nights I feel as though this really helps, and on others it's hard to tell the difference. Still, I think there is reason to believe that this supplement is safe and likely effective for many people. It's a worthy addition on evenings when you need to get to sleep or recalibrate your sleep pattern. It certainly won't knock you out, but it also won't make you feel groggy when you wake up.
