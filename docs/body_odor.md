## Possible Causes
---
There are many possible causes of bad body odor, or "bromhidrosis." Some causes are due to dangerous medical pathology - for example: heavy metal exposure, liver failure, and some metabolic diseases. If you think you may have one of these problems, you should consult your doctor immediately. Please see my full medical disclaimer [here](https://kornweissmedical.com/disclaimer/).

There are more common causes that likely plague many of us. I'll review a few of these, and talk about some of the measures I've taken for myself and my clients to help them improve body odor.

### 1. The Skin Microbiome 
- The axillary (arm-pit) microbiome likely plays a large role in body odor. There is compelling evidence from the scientific literature to suggest that certain bacteria, when mixed with apocrine sweat, will cause the production of volatile compounds. The scent may be worse when the subject is under stress, as the apocrine, rather than the eccrine glands are stimulated to increase secretion by the sympathetic nervous system. These glands produce sweat which contains 
Foods Food - onion, garlic, curry, coffee, etc.
1. Heavy metal exposure
2. Liver Failure - ammonia
3. Metabolic Diseases
4. Current medications/supplements

## Ruling Out Dangerous Causes

---
- Liver failure - no reason to suspect based on symptoms and labs
- Heavy metal exposure - no reason to suspect based on symptoms and recent urine heavy metals
  - can consider more thorough heavy metals eval with genova ion panel (we've discussed before)
- Metabolic disease - no reason to suspect based on recent labs and evaluation
- Current medications/supplements - my understanding is you're not taking 'nything at the moment
  - let's review this again to make sure
