# Introduction

***Purpose***: This post explains how to lose weight, or more precisely, how to eliminate the intake of excess energy.

***Reason***: The consumption of excess energy for one's given purpose contributes towards feeling and looking heavy, sluggish, and uncomfortable, and eventually, or maybe even quickly, contributes towards ill-health, followed by, in many cases, an early demise.

1. Eating significant amounts of energy dense, nutrient poor foods
2. Lacking "food" limits
3. Lacking time limits
4. Lacking quantity limits
5. Lacking a long-term nutrition goal
6. Carbohydrate dependence
