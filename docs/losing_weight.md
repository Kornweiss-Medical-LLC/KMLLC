# Introduction

***Purpose***: This post explains how to lose weight, or more precisely, how to eliminate the intake of excess energy.

***Reason***: The consumption of excess energy for one's given purpose contributes towards feeling and looking heavy, sluggish, and uncomfortable, and eventually, or maybe even quickly, contributes towards ill-health, followed by, in many cases, an early demise. On the flip side, consuming adequate energy is time and money efficient, and contributes towards a body and mind that operate energetically, and necessarily give the same integrated appearance of a healthy, able, productive mind and body.

# Causes of Excess Energy Consumption
1. Availability of energy-dense foods
2. Eating energy-dense foods
3. Lacking "food" limits
4. Lacking time limits
5. Lacking quantity limits
6. Lacking a long-term nutrition goal
7. Carbohydrate dependence

# Tactics to Avoid Each Cause of Excess Energy Consumption
## How to Avoid Eating Energy Dense, Nutrient Poor Foods
- Track your nutrition with [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com) to learn which foods are energy dense.
- Eat nutrient rich, energy poor foods first
- Don't eat unless you are hungry for a nutrient dense food
- Don't buy foods that have a low nutrient to energy ratio
- Understand how much energy you do need, and how to obtain it from nutrient dense foods
- Understand when you need more energy than usual
- Understand that being hungry is different than being hungry for X

## How to Impose Food Limits
- Adopt a rational definition of the concept "food."
- Eat only food.
- Divide foods into two categories - foods that are ~100% vital nutrients vs. those that are not
- Do not buy non-foods

## How to Impose Time Restrictions
- Time-restricted feeding
- Intermittent fasting
- Bed-time
- Skipping breakfast
- Timing meals with other activities, such as workouts

## How to Impose Quantity Restrictions
- Portion size
  - eat foods that require prep and prep only what you'll eat
  - decide how much you'll eat before you start
  - weigh the food
  - record what you're eating as you  eat it
- Energy quantity
  - weight/measure the amount of energy in what you're eating, match it to requirements
  - this can be part of a larger diet plan
- Satiety
  - go by satiety
  - eat 65% of what you could eat, stop for 20 minutes

## How to Create a standing long-term nutrition goal
- create a long term goal - look good, feel good, perform well, be energetic
- every time you go to eat, ask if the thing you're eating, at the time you're eating it, in the amount you're eating contributes towards or detracts from your goal

## Eliminate carbohydrate dependence
- carbohydrate dependence/insulin resistance contributes towards constant hunger
- a fast, or a ketogenic induction diet is very useful to eliminate this dependence
- during this induction period, it's not necessary or a good idea to restrict the quantity or the time during which you're eating

## Integrating the Plan
- Peter Attia's 3 axis model
  - always be pulling on at least 1: time, quantity, type (macros)
- Have a reason, a purpose that matters to you, that is very long-term
  - also have short-term and medium term goals

## Tips and Tricks
- don't buy it
- go all in - if you are choosing whether to have just 1 bite, or 50 cals, vs 0 - have 0
- variety
- be process oriented, not outcome oriented
