**Empty Bladder**

Empty your bladder and ensure at least 5 minutes of quiet rest before measurements.

**Correct Setting**

Donâ€™t drink caffeinated beverages or exercise within 30 minutes before measuring your blood pressure.

**Positioning**

Sit with your back straight and supported (on a dining chair, rather than a sofa). Your feet should be flat on the floor and your legs should not be crossed. Your arm should be supported on a flat surface (such as a table) **with the upper arm at heart level**.

**Cuff Position**

Don't take the measurement over clothes. Make sure the bottom of the cuff is placed directly *above* the bend of the elbow. Check your monitor's instructions for an illustration.

**Timing**

Measure three times daily. Once in the morning, once around midday, and once in the evening.
