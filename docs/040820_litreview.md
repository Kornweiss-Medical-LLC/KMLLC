## Recombinant ACE2-IgG Fusion Treatment
SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 transmembrane protein to gain entry to cells, which is the first step in infection. Researchers are using this knowledge to develop a novel treatment against the virus. Normally, the virus binds to ACE2 on the cell surface, which allows the virus to be pulled into the cell in a process called endocytosis. But, what if the virus encountered ACE2 proteins floating in the blood stream which were connected to [immune-globulins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G#Function). Instead of binding to cell surfaces and invading cells, viral particles would be bound in the blood stream by these ACE2-IgG proteins and would then be destroyed by other immune cells and/or other parts of the immune system. You can think of this therapy as presenting the virus with a decoy receptor. This therapy is being tested in mice and has been demonstrated to be effective at binding to SARS-CoV-2. Here is an excerpt from [the paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/02/02/2020.02.01.929976.full.pdf)

> "After we identified that ACE2 fusion proteins binds with high affinity to the RBD,
we next sought to test the inhibitory activity of ACE2 fusion proteins against 2019-nCoV
and compare it with that against SARS-CoV, we used viruses pseudotyped with the S
glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. Our data shows that Both SARS-CoV and
2019-nCoV viruses were potently neutralized by ACE2-Ig and mACE2-Ig. The IC50 of
SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV viruses neutralized by ACE2-Ig were 0.8 and 0.1 μg/ml,
respectively."

## Using D-dimer to Guide Anticoagulation in Covid-19 Patients

This study is pre-print and not yet peer-reviewed, and it's out of China. But, it is suggestive that in severely ill Covid-19 patients with elevated D-dimer, there is a correlation with improved mortality outcomes and therapeutic anticoagulation as D-dimer increases. D-dimer >3 seems to look like a reasonable cutoff which was also the conclusion of the authors.

Excerpts and data from [this study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jth.14817)

> "severe COVID-19 was defined as meeting any one of following items, according to the Diagnosis and
Treatment Plan of COVID-19 suggested by National Health Commission of China [9]: Respiratory rate
≥30 breaths /min; Arterial oxygen saturation≤93% at rest; PaO2/FiO2 ≤300 mmHg"

> "The association between heparin treatment and outcome in stratified patients according to SIC
score or D-dimer result were evaluated (Table 4 and Figure 2). The heparin treat was associated with
lower mortality in patients with SIC score ≥4 (40.0% vs 64.2%, P=0.029), but not in those with SIC
score <4 (29.0% vs 22.6%, P=0.419). As patients were stratified by D-dimer result, the mortality in
heparin users basically maintained at same level, but in nonusers, the mortality rised with the rising
D-dimer. When D-dimer exceeding 3.0 ug/mL (6 fold of upper limit of normal, 6 ULN), approximate
20% reduction in mortality with heparin treat was found (32.8% vs 52.4%, P=0.017)."

> " In addition, the hypoxia found in severe COVID-19 can stimulate
thrombosis through not only increasing blood viscosity, but also a hypoxia-inducible transcription
factor-dependent signaling pathway [14]. As evidence, occlusion and microthrombosis formation in
pulmonary small vessels of critical patient with COVID-19 has been reported from a recent lung organ
dissection [15]."
