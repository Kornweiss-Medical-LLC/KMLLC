## I am Assuming I will Contract the Disease
As an ER doctor, I am probably going to contract Covid-19. I am slightly
worried about this, but all evidence at this time points to an
over-estimation of the severity of the disease. There is likely
reporting bias in favor of recognizing and reporting only severe cases.
Most of the mortality is in older individuals with pre-existing
cardiopulmonary problems. That said, this does appear to be more severe
than current strains of influenza, so some precautions are reasonable.

## Current Strategy
Overall, I agree with Amesh Adalja
[\@ameshaa](https://twitter.com/AmeshAA?s=20) who thinks that
containment is not a viable strategy at this point. It's likely that
many if not most people will be exposed to this virus at some time. The
only good reason I can think of to actively try to avoid exposure now,
is that this virus may be less robust in a month or two when weather
warms. If you are able to avoid infection this season, there is a chance
of being vaccinated (if it is developed in time) before next season when
this virus is likely to return.

## Inviduals at High Risk
Lastly, if you do have a history of cardiopulmonary disease such as
heart failure or COPD, attempting to avoid infection to the best of your
ability is a very good idea. Anyone who begins to feel short of breath
should seek immediate medical care.

My goal here is to provide distilled, accurate, and timely information.
