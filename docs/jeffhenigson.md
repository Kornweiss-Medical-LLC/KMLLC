# Read Your Medical Records or Suffer Like Jeff Henigson

> “And yet despite this being extraordinary, you nevertheless believe that this is what you have managed to survive?”

> My head jerked back. “Excuse me?”

> “I am asking you.”

> I was close to hanging up. “What exactly are you asking me?” I said.

> “I am sorry. I am perhaps not clear. English is not my first language.” He paused. “May I share a story with you?”

> I sighed and rolled my eyes. “Tell me your story.”

On March 26, 2021, I read [the story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2021/03/26/my-life-was-upended-35-years-by-cancer-diagnosis-doctor-just-told-me-i-was-misdiagnosed/) of Jeff Henigson. At the age of fifteen, Jeff was diagnosed with brain cancer. He was subsequently treated with six weeks of radiation and six sessions of chemotherapy over the course of the following year.

Jeff lived in fear for most of his life that his brain tumor would return and end his life. He was told that his particular type of brain cancer usually kills victims within two to three years of diagnosis. Yet, Jeff is still alive twenty years later. He suffers from epilepsy, which he believes is likely from the radiation treatments he received as a young man.

Two months ago, Jeff received a life-changing letter from retired neuropathologist Karl Schwarz. That letter changed his life. Jeff's tale is one of the most heart wrenching stories I've heard in a long time. Jeff published his own story in the Washington Post.

It's worth the twelve minutes it will take you to read the [article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2021/03/26/my-life-was-upended-35-years-by-cancer-diagnosis-doctor-just-told-me-i-was-misdiagnosed/). When you’re done, you will be 100% convinced of the importance of reading your own medical records.

Jeff's [story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2021/03/26/my-life-was-upended-35-years-by-cancer-diagnosis-doctor-just-told-me-i-was-misdiagnosed/) could change your life. It is well written, public, and unbelievable, but not unique or unusual.

## Third-Party Medical Record Retrieval and Digitization Service
I’m trying a new service from a company called [Picnic Health](https://picnichealth.com/). Their [web service](https://app.picnichealth.com/onboard/account/get-started) will collect, digitize, and tabulate all of your medical records, labs, and actual imaging. You only need to pay $300, sign a records release consent form, and submit the names of the hospitals, labs, and doctors that you’ve visited in the past. In most cases, a partial name and location is all that’s needed for PicnicHealth’s team to track down your records. There is a $39/month fee for record maintenance that can be cancelled at any time. They advertise record retrieval and digitization within 4-6 weeks of submission. I am waiting for my records at this time. I’ll provide an update on the service in the future.

## How to Get Your Own Records

In the meantime, if you go to a doctor, lab, hospital, or imaging center, you can and should request your records in full including all results and ***imaging on disc***. Many hospitals will now be providing easy access to physician and nursing notes via a new government mandated initiative called “open notes.” This should make it easier for you to review your physician’s notes without having to track down your records and send faxes and snail mail.
