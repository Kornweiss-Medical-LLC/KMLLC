**Medical Record Collection**

I can perform this service in-house, but I prefer my clients to use a service called [Picnic Health](https://picnichealth.com/how-it-works). This is a digital service that collects, scans, encrypts, and digitizes all of your medical records. It requires little effort to set up an account. You’ll be able to share this with me easily and it’ll enable me to review your records in an efficient manner. This service is independent of my practice, so you’ll retain this useful resource in the future if you leave my practice or visit other physicians. You can click the link above to get started.

**Intake Interview**

This is a 90 minute Zoom Call which is used to assess your past and current health, health and performance goals, ability and willingness to undergo testing and interventions

I’ll ask you about past and current medical problems, surgeries, hospitalizations, doctor visits, allergies, immunizations, medications, supplements, nutrition, exercise, sleep, and stress management. I’ll assess your appetite for potential testing and interventions in order to determine the appropriate intensity of your individualized health plan.

**Connect Health Data Streams**

**Initial Nutrition, Sleep, and Exercise Tracking**

My clients use Cronometer to track nutrition for 10 days in order to establish a baseline. Sleep can be tracked manually or with a sleep tracking device. I prefer the ŌURA Ring. Exercise can be tracked by sharing logs from apps like Strava or Training Peaks, or by sharing manually recorded logs.

**Health Analysis Report**

The initial health analysis report is a comprehensive document that contains all relevant health information in an organized fashion with tables and graphs where appropriate. The data is followed by my assessment of the client’s risks, which are prioritized by a combination of magnitude, proximity, and manageability. The risks are followed by goals, objectives, and recommendations including a preventive care schedule. Individualized intermediate metrics are provided. Performance goals are addressed individually.
