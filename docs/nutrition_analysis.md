   - Repeat

# Filling in the Framework
   
## Goals and Metrics

First, I write down an explicit goal such as, "I want to lose 5 pounds." Or, a much broader goal, such as, "I want to live as long as possible, but I also want to look and feel strong, energetic, and lean." For a narrow goal, like the first one, I might only track weight. For a broader goal, like the second one, I might need to establish a longer list of metrics to track my progress (e.g. weight, body fat %, subjective energy level, exercise capacity, hba1c%, lipids, etc.).

In reality, I don't have just one goal at a time, but I do work on one goal at a time. What I have is a hierarchy of goals that is ruled by a broad goal, but is executed in terms of simpler goals like the first one above.

## Assessment
After my goal is established, I evaluate my current nutrition status by tracking everything I eat and drink for a minimum of 1 week (not as hard as it sounds - I will demonstrate how to do this simply in a later post. To avoid appearing enigmatic here, the basic approach is to use an app called Cronometer).

## Identify and Remove Contradictions

Next, I evaluate which parts of my current nutrition contradict my goal. If my goal is to lose weight, the obvious contradiction would be any food that provides excess energy intake - i.e. too many calories.

So, in this instance, my intervention would be to eliminate any food that is a source of excess energy but which is not essential to my other nutrition needs - i.e. vitamins, minerals, essential fats, amino acids, etc.

## Add Essentials

I add necessities that were missing (e.g. sources of calcium, vitamin A, C, D, choline, etc.) without adding back any excess energy. The best way to do this is usually to use nutrient dense, energy poor foods. I'll discuss this in more detail in a later post - but examples of nutrient-dense energy-poor foods are non-root vegetables such as green leaves, peppers, crucifers, fish, lean meat, eggs, and organ meats.

## Execute New Plan

Lastly, I track *everything* I consume until I learn how to eat my new plan without tracking.

## Reassess and Repeat

I follow metrics for a predetermined time frame and then reassess the original goal and my progress towards that goal. The time frame needs to be long enough to see the relationship between cause and effect; that is, between intervention and results. The time frame should be short enough to maintain motivation and to make quick improvements. In the case of losing 5 pounds, this is reasonably achievable in 2-6 weeks, so this interval would be a good reassessment time period.

Once the reassessment is done - repeat the whole process, including adjusting the goal if needed.

In my next post, I'll break down more details and explain how to execute the above plan with specific examples.

# Nutrition Facts

It is necessary to understand some basics of nutrition before this type of plan can be executed. Of course it's possible to adopt a cookie cutter nutrition plan, but this will only get you so far. Understanding some nutrition basics will enable you to make infinite adjustments, achieve new goals, and to consistently improve independently without trying to seek out a pre-made plan that applies only to some non-existant "average" person, but not to you in particular.

## Macronutrients
*Proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.*

### Protein
*Used to make muscle and enzymes*

Protein is a nitrogenous organic compound made up of amino acids. Amino acids from dietary protein are used to build muscle and enzymes. Protein can also be metabolized to release energy if consumed in excess or in energy poor states such as starvation. Protein contributes relatively little to energy consumption under most circumstances in comparison to fats and carbohydrates.

### Fat and Carbohydrate

You can think of fat and carbohydrates as your two energy/fuel sources. These fuels can be burned as they are consumed, but they can also be stored in various locations in different forms (e.g. muscle glycogen, subcutaneous adipocytes, muscle triglyceride, visceral adipocytes, etc.). Fats and carbohydrates play many other roles in biology including cell signaling, immunity, structure, and many other roles. But, for nutrition purposes, the simplest starting place is to consider these macronutrients as your fuel mixture.

## Determining Macronutrient Intake


Under normal circumstances, to determine appropriate macronutrient intake, you need to determine 2 primary things:

### 1. Building-block requirement
  - This depends primarily on maintenance of existing muscle mass and desired gain/loss of additional muscle
  - If you merely want to maintain, a safe starting point is to take in at least 1 g/kg-body-weight/day of protein
  - If you want to gain, an initial approach can be to take an additional 1g/kg/day of desired additional muscle gain. 

- #### Example: 
  If you weigh 70kg, take 70g protein to maintain current mass. If you want to gain 5kg of muscle, take an additional 5g of protein daily until goal weight is reached, at which point the new maintenance dose is 75g.
  
### 2. Desired energy balance
  - This depends on existing fuel stores (fat, glycogen) and the desire to gain or lose these stores (gain or lose weight).
  - If you want to maintain weight - you calculate or estimate basal metabolic rate and match caloric intake to this.
  - If you want to gain weight - you add on top of basal rate, usually primarily in the form of carbohydrate or fat.
  - If you want to lose weight - decrease energy intake or expend more energy.
    #### Decreasing energy intake
      - 3 ways to do this
        1. Decrease daily caloric intake spread roughly evenly across time and macro groups (e.g. general dieting, portion control, fasting-mimicking diet etc.)
        2. Decrease feeding time window or frequency (e.g. intermittent fasting, time-restricted feeding)
        3. Decrease a specific macronutrient group (e.g. low-fat, keto, low-carb, etc.)
    
      - You can also combine the above 3 strategies, though cutting more than one thing at a time (time window, macro group, caloric intake), the more difficult to maintain, and the more likely are deficiencies to arise and cause unintended consequences.

## Micronutrients
- Micronutrients are all other nutrients - vitamins (e.g. B vitamins, A, C, D, etc), minerals (Calcium, Potassium, Zinc, Iron, etc.)
- You can think of micronutrients as "parts" - these are "parts" of a machine that don't provide energy for the machine to run, nor are they really structural (i.e. building-blocks), but rather they're special parts or substances that enable the machine to run properly.
- Your body, under normal circumstances, is good at regulating micronutrients and compensating for short-term deficits. But, long-term deficits can cause serious problems that can be hard to diagnose.
- There are "recommended daily" intakes and allowances for micronutrients to try to prevent deficiencies in "the general public."
- In my opinion, the best way to make sure you are replete in micronutrients isÀù to compose your diet primarily of what I call "nutrient-dense energy-poor whole foods." These are foods like meat, fish, and above-ground vegetables such as green leaves, peppers, sprouts, crucifers. Fruit, nuts, and seeds are also featured in this category, but less so. The reason to form the core of the diet out of these foods, is that a diverse intake of these will lead to a full complement of micronutrients, but will leave ample room to titrate other foods to meet energy demands.
- Once micronutrient needs are met, one can add other foods like - additional fruits, nuts, seeds, oils, root vegetables (e.g. potatoes, beets, carrots), grains, rice, and pasta.

## Where and How do I Start to Figure this Out?
*The best way to figure out what to do in any big project, is first to assess the current situation.*

Making changes to your diet is really hard, and making tons of changes at once is nearly impossible.

So, to make improvements, it's best to identify the current state of affairs. That's why step #1 when trying to change your nutrition plan is always...

## Logging

**Here is an example of a young woman's single-day food log**

*Whole foods are highlighted, processed foods left with white background*

The right-most column shows calories. Calories is the unit of measure of energy. So, you can think of these numbers as units of energy. Taking in excess energy compared to energy expenditure requires storing this energy as fat (fat can be stored under the skin, within muscles, and within other organs as well) and glycogen (this is the storage form of carbohydrate and can be found in every organ, and most abundantly in muscle). 

Metabolic syndrome (disordered metabolism which includes "diseases" like type 2 Diabetes, hypertension, and fatty liver disease to name a few), while complex, can be thought of as disordered energy storage (and its downstream effects), usually due to over-consumption of energy containing substances such as fats and carbohydrates.

Imagine you filled the gas-tank of your car, but you wanted your car to have more gas - you might pour it on top of the engine, inside the passenger compartment, inside the coolant intake, the oil intake, the washer fluid intake, and any other nook and cranny you might find. Eventually, this is going to damage the machine. This is certainly an imperfect analogy - but the point is that the human body can only store so much energy before the tanks are full and it begins to run out of safe places for storage.

**Now look at this image, which shows the macro breakdown of the highlighted food items in the previous picture (whole-foods only)**

![body](images/cs_crono_041520/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-15%20at%2012.02.45%20PM.png)

We see that when a handful of processed foods are eliminated, the caloric intake is only 1545 calories. For a young, healthy, athletic woman, this is almost certainly a caloric deficit. Go back up to the previous image, and notice how much food can be consumed without consuming a huge amount of energy. Adding in just a few processed foods like protein shakes, crackers, and popcorn gets you back up to 2225 calories. And - I was even generous including the peanut butter, which I consider to be processed. Peanuts are, of course, the unprocessed version.


## What to do now?

So, if you were this individual, and you wanted to improve nutrient intake while minimizing caloric intake, what could you do?

### 1. Reduce unnecessary protein
- Body weight in this example is approximately 70kg. If not trying to build muscle, you could reduce protein intake to 70 grams. If you're active and want to be on the safe side with protein, round up to 100 grams. Protein intake, including the shakes was 164 grams.
- Each shake was 45 grams of protein.
- Remove both of these shakes and you're down to 74 grams of protein. This is adequate.

### 2. Remove any energy dense/nutrient poor foods
- Nut butters, dried fruits, jams, processed foods are usually very high on this list.
- In this example, we can remove peanut butter (1 tbsp - and save ~100 calories) without losing hardly any micronutrients. We can also remove the 14 crackers, and achieve another 130 kcal deficit without losing any micronutrients. Do this with any similar foods. Cronometer is your friend in looking at micronutrient content.

### 3. Add energy poor nutrient dense foods
- Add green leaves, crucifers (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, etc), peppers, and if desired, some roots like carrots. Be careful of beets and potatoes - high energy content.

### 4. Look at micronutrients in cronometer
- use built-in RDAs at first, and later, if able, you can titrate micronutrient requirements.
