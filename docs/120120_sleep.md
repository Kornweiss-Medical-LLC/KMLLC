In 1959, a well known radio personality named Peter Tripp staged an experiment in New York City's Central Park where he endeavored to stay awake for 200 hours. He barely succeeded, experiencing hallucinations of spiders and mice, becoming hostile, incomprehensible, and eventually falling asleep for thirteen hours. Reports of his life afterwards are of a man who experienced regular episodes of psychosis and who subsequently lost his marriage and his work.

Six years later, a seventeen year old high-school student form San Diego named Randy Gardner set out to break Tripp's record and succeeded at staying awake for 264 hours. He experienced confusion, hallucinations (thinking a street sign was a person), and an inability to focus on simple cognitive tasks like "serial sevens" - (this is a test that involves subtracting the number seven from one-hundred repeatedly, i.e. 100 --> 93 --> 86 --> and so on). He made it to sixty-five and then suddenly stopped because he forgot what he was doing. At the end of the experiment, he slept for fifteen hours and awoke feeling back to his normal self. He attended school the next day.

In 2005, Mike Trevino, a well known endurance athlete, competed in the Race Across America. In this race, athletes attempt to cross the country by road bicycle as quickly as possible. In order to win, athletes have learned to operate on a bare-minimum of sleep, perhaps only one to two hours at a time. Mike completed the race in eight days racking up a cumulative sleep time between ten and eleven hours for the whole eight day period. In [his interview on Peter Attia's podcast](https://peterattiamd.com/miketrevino/), Mike describes the process.

He explains that he tries to sleep for a single REM (rapid eye movement) sleep cycle and wake up immediately at the end of the REM cycle. The typical REM cycle lasts only ninety minutes. To time this perfectly, he learned from another athlete to have his wife watch his eye movements while he slept and to wake him up as soon as they stop moving, as waking up just after a REM cycle allows you to feel reasonably awake, whereas awakening in the middle of a REM cycle, or in a deep sleep cycle results in feeling groggy.

In this particular year (I am not sure if it was 2004 or 2005), he had slept less than two hours by day six or seven of the race. He says this in reference to his support team who followed him in a van,

> "I thought they were spies. I was truly delusional, and I was paranoid. I would try to get away from them, and I kept racing away from them, and they're still following me, and they're turning where I'm turning...and finally I decided to get off the highway, and I'm in a cemetary in the middle of nowhere and I hold up my bike, it's all I had to protect myself, in between me and my crew, and they followed me...this van is here and they get out, and I'm like what are you doing?"

The cognitive dysfunction is severe and obvious in such marked cases of sleep deprivation, but the sleep research literature is filled with studies of memory, cognition, and reaction time studies on much milder sleep deprivation. Consider for instance studies demonstrating delayed reaction times and inappropriate line-crossings in drivers who slept only two hours versus eight hours. There is certainly inter-individual variability in the response to sleep deprivation, but it's incontrovertible that obtaining adequate sleep is essential.

Many sleep experts emphasize the cruciality of adequate sleep, and may go so far as to say that "losing" even an hour of sleep per night is detrimental to short-term and long-term health, and contributes to the development of diseases like cardiovascular disease and dementia. Although this may be true to a certain degree for certain individuals, I think it's difficult if not impossible to demonstrate this effect in a given individual. While it's true that some people require seven or eight hours per night, it seems similarly true that others require only six, and yet others require nine. It's also been proposed that lost sleep cannot be made up by increased sleep on subsequent nights. I think this is similarly hard to prove.

After listening to sleep experts make these assertions, I attempted for months to engineer, monitor, and optimize my sleep. But, this approach leaves out the full context of sleep which requires me to compare the value of sleep to other values in my life, all of which require me to be awake. For instance, my rigid and zealous approach to sleep limits my ability to work late at night when the mood strikes, and similarly limits social activities. It's easy to become obsessed with sleep to the point of being afraid to get into bed thirty minutes later than normal, or to get up earlier or later than usual out of fear of disturbing my circadian rhythm. But, then this gives rise to something which has been called "sleep anxiety," which itself can lead to limited and fragmented sleep.

The answer, as always, is likely somewhere in the middle. So, I've attempted below to go over what I think are the most impactful ideas that I've used to help optimize my sleep, not with the goal of optimizing sleep and sleep alone, but with the idea of optimizing sleep within the full context of a lifetime.

### Live Soundly, Sleep Soundly

More than anything else, I think that what I do while I'm awake determines how well I sleep. I think that those who sleep most soundly, are those who live most soundly. Living soundly means living with purpose and integrity; with values and with moral consistency. In order to do this, it's necessary for me to choose, rank, and pursue my values every day. This is hard work. If I manage to do this successfully for a full day, I'm tired at the end of the day. The more tired I am at the end of the day, the better I sleep, no matter the conditions. When I'm really exhausted from a good day's work, I can sleep on the floor, with an empty stomach, in eighty five degrees, in my work clothes. When I fail to pursue my values, or worse, if I act against my values, I don't feel tired, I feel anxious, stressed, and restless. I can't sleep even in perfect conditions. For instance, some days I set a list of tasks that I want to complete, but I decide instead to browse social media under the guise of "networking." I know very well that I'm not doing my work, and at the end of the day, instead of wanting to sleep, I feel the need to stay awake either to finish the work I didn't do, or subconsciously to punish myself for failing to do what I know I should have done.

Besides the mental and physical exhaustion that results from hard work, I'm able to judge myself as having earned my rest when I've done what I set out to do. When I lie down in a dark quiet room, instead of my subconscious mind generating the restlessness that comes from regret, I instead feel relaxed and serene because I pursued my values.

To prove this theory to myself, I performed a thought experiment, or more accurately, I thought back to arguably the most stressful time period of my life -- medical residency. During this three year period, I was under constant stress, I ate poorly, my exercise was lacking, I drank ample caffeine at all hours of the day and night, I switched constantly from day shifts to night shifts, I followed almost zero conventional sleep recommendations, and yet I slept soundly wherever and whenever I wanted. Perhaps this was in part due to sheer physical and mental exhaustion, but that can't account for the whole of it. In fact, I had some rotations during which there was ample time to sleep and I was not exhausted, but I slept well nonetheless because I was working hard at something I loved. There was one brief period during which my sleep suffered, and predictably, this was a period of weeks during which I was very disappointed in my own clinical performance. During this period of fragmented sleep, I was actually on one of the most difficult rotations that allowed me the least possible time to sleep, and so I was the most exhausted I could have been, and yet I couldn't sleep. As soon as I resolved the psychological distress, sleep returned.

There aren't any sleep hacks, supplements, medications, or blue-blockers that will overcome a mind at war with itself. You can take prescription strength sedatives, or drink yourself into a stupor, but not only does this not produce restful sleep, it obviously contributes to the cycle of value destruction and regret that prevented sleep in the first place.

I asked one of my very thoughtful colleagues, Dr. Michael Garrett, owner and physician of Direct MD in Austin, Texas, what he thought of my ideas on this topic, and this is what he had to say:

> "I think you are probably onto something with the mental aspect and an unintegrated mind. But I have not given it a lot of thought, frankly. I would say that a lot of patients I see with insomnia issues have anxiety, and then sleep anxiety, which is a self-perpetuating problem. (There's a lot of "I'm only going to get 5 hours, I'm only going to get 4 hours" type thoughts, and they often seem to set neural patterns of those anxious thought pathways, which reinforces the problem.)  I suspect that you are onto something that if they do not have enough purposeful activity or organizing principles for their life, that contributes to or exacerbates the problem.
> 
> I will say that the effective thing, by far, for my patients has been finding a good CBT-I therapist. (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia.) I found one here locally (Austin, TX), [Dr. Chelsea Vaughn PhD](http://drchelseavaughan.com/). Her assistance has been life-changing for several of my patients with long term sleep problems. It's something like 6 or 8 therapy session, as well as some homework (sleep diary, etc) and sleep restriction. Works absolute wonders and has helped me get several people off any sleeping meds for the first time in years or decades."

I also asked a very thoughtful non-physician, [Jason Crawford](https://jasoncrawford.org/), a former software engineer and now expert and pioneer of an intellectual movement called "progress studies," he writes for his blog [rootsofprogress.org](https://rootsofprogress.org/), what he thought on this topic. Here is his reply to me:

"Hmm. I'm sure that psychological problems that cause stress/anxiety can interfere with sleep. But there can be all sorts of things, not every sleep problem is psychological.

> "I used to have a lot of trouble getting to sleep. In early 2013 I did some research, made a list of all the things that people said might help, and experimented with them. It turned out that what I was most sensitive to was light. Keeping the lights in the apartment on brightly right up until bedtime, and using computer screens, was keeping me up. (Also I was in an apartment that had a street light shining through the window.) I started using the dimmer switch on the light in the evening, and I got an app called F.lux for my laptop that turns the screen orange in the evening to avoid blue light. I use a similar feature on my iPhone and Kindle now. I also got a sunrise alarm clock that wakes me in the morning using light. And I got blackout curtains to block the street lamp at night. I experimented with those orange glasses, too, but they're bulky and uncomfortable and if I do those other things I don't need them.
> 
> That plus don't have caffeine in the evening, pretty much does it for me. Other things didn't seem to be so important, like temperature of the room, etc.
> 
> All that said, I have had times in my life/career when I was anxious and stressed from things going on in life/work. On some occasions that has made it hard to sleep. It wasn't about an integrated mind exactly, nor was it about not doing enough during the day. It was about an ongoing difficult situation. I need to deliberately stop thinking about it in those cases. It can be hard because I have a certain sense of responsibility: if there's an important problem it feels irresponsible to stop thinking about it! In those cases I remind myself that I'm not going to solve the problem or even really make progress while I'm lying in bed going to sleep. Therefore it doesn't help to think about it, and therefore it's not irresponsible to stop thinking about it. In fact, the responsible thing to do is to stop thinking about it so I can get to sleep and tackle the problem the next day well-rested."

Another friend of mine, Joe England, MD, a neuro-radiologist who works a week of night shifts and then a week of day shifts, had this to say:

> "I doubt I have any especially good insights. I think having daily actions integrated with your values is probably an important condition but I'm not sure that it is the crucial issue that stops most people from sleeping well. For me, making sure I'm tired at night is the most important thing (so less coffee, more exercise, not sleeping in, less screen time before bed). Also, being outdoors at night before bed helps. If I sit on my patio with very low light and read a book, I get more tired for bed. I think my subconscious mind better appreciates that it is night time."

These people have spent a lot of time dealing with sleep on a personal level, and in Dr. Garrett's case, as a physician helping to treat patients with disordered sleep. Their answers are a good segway into the sections that follow, each of which discusses a technique or variable that can affect sleep.

### Cognitive Off-loading

For me, this is the single most impactful activity that has made it easier for me to go straight to sleep. I have to shut my day down and make a plan for the next day. Not only does this give me a quiet mind when I hit the pillow, it also sets me up to feel motivated when I wake up in the morning.

This process starts by getting as much done during the day as possible, and whatever is left undone gets scheduled for a specific time in the future.

If I have tasks left over in the evening, I solve this problem by journaling and getting my task lists prepared for the next day. This activity allows my subconscious to relax. I was inspired to do this consistently after reading Cal Newport's book "Deep Work." In the book, he talks about doing a ["shut down"](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2009/06/08/drastically-reduce-stress-with-a-work-shutdown-ritual/) at the end of the work day akin to shutting down your computer.

### Timing

Having a consistent sleep schedule will establish a routine, a pattern, and habits surrounding sleeping and waking that your mind and body will grow accustomed to. The strongest zeitgeber (literally time-giver - or signal to the brain about the time of day), and strongest means of entraining the circadian rhythm, is light. Thus, if it's possible to wake with sunrise and sleep just after sunset, I think this is likely optimal for most people.

I personally have difficulty with this due to the nature of my work, but when possible, I try to stick to a schedule.

### Preparation

Having a routine to deliver bedtime cues to your subconscious can be useful. As I indicated above, I think the most useful preparation for bed is the mental preparation of cognitive off-loading.

Some other examples include stretching, reading, listening to a podcast ([my favorite podcast](https://jockopodcast.com/)) or audiobook ([my current audiobook as of July, 2020](https://www.audible.com/pd/Grit-Audiobook/B01D3AC5BA)), or taking a hot shower. Just make sure the activity doesn't conflict with the other recommendations (e.g. starting a new project, eating, or exercising vigorously just before bed). I usually listen to a podcast with the sleep timer set to 15 or 30 minutes. Sometimes I do mobility work with a foam roller or a [mobility "peanut"](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A9XPNOQ/ref=as_sl_pc_as_ss_li_til?tag=kornweissmedi-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=bc4a9cd29351079f06dea5563685d27d&creativeASIN=B00A9XPNOQ) if my muscles feel physically tense.

### Light

Sleep experts recommend total darkness in the bedroom while sleeping and they recommend eliminating blue-light exposure in the late-afternoon and evening. Blue-light delays the secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland. This melatonin release is one of the signals that likely initiates a sensation of fatigue and the drive to sleep.

I aim for darkness in the bedroom, but I do have a couple very dim LEDs and some outside light that filters into the room that don't seem to bother me--it's possible that they are limiting my sleep, and I have noticed that total darkness does seem to produce the most restful uninterrupted sleep, at least subjectively. I do use [night shift mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207570) on my Apple devices in the evening, which cuts the blue light out of the screen. I also dim these devices as low as they'll go after sundown. For non-Apple devices, there are often similar settings built in, or you can use an application called "f.lux." I dim my house lights to minimal brightness and use as few lights as necessary.

Some people really go all out by installing red-spectrum lights in their house and wearing blue-blocking glasses in the afternoon or evening. I've never tried this, but if you have a real problem getting to sleep, this might be worth looking into. Peter Attia, MD, one of my favorite resources on sleep, nutrition, and longevity medicine discusses this at length in multiple places on his [website](https://peterattiamd.com/category/sleep/) and [podcast](https://peterattiamd.com/ama04/). In July, 2020, he recommended [these glasses](https://shopfelixgray.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=G_PS_Brand_Felix_Gray_Priority_B_E_P&utm_adgroup=G_PS_Brand_Felix_Gray_Priority_Brand_Name_E&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI4sf3x9fL6gIVSuDICh225wQ5EAAYASAAEgKc-vD_BwE) from a company called Felix Gray. I have not tried these myself.

### Temperature

Cooling of the core body temperature may help with sleep initiation.

I sleep at 71 or 72 degrees in the summer on most nights, and in the winter I heat my house to around 65 degrees. I adjust my clothing until I feel comfortable. I have mixed feelings on this one, because I have found that sleeping in warmer temperatures in the summer has helped me acclimatize to the heat and allows me to feel more comfortable outside in hot temperatures. If I sleep at temps consistently cooler than 72, I feel pretty uncomfortable in 98 degrees F during the day.

There is probably a good balance here that can be found on a case-by-case basis. Overall, if you're having trouble getting to sleep and you're also over-heated, cooling the house by a degree or two might be a good step to take. For those who have serious problems overheating at night and need drastically cooler temperatures than their bed-fellow, a cooling pad such as the [Ooler](https://www.chilitechnology.com/products/ooler-sleep-system?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_Yud9pzL6gIVkZOzCh1ClQEJEAAYASAAEgLuVvD_BwE) or [chiliPAD](https://www.chilitechnology.com/products/chilipad-sleep-system) (both Trademarks of Chili) may prove useful. I haven't yet tried either one.

### Food

I try to stop eating at least 3 hours before bed which is essential for those who suffer from acid reflux, but also less obviously, for those who don't. If you need to eat closer to bed time, keep it down to small items and consider eating carbohydrates rather than fat and protein. The reason for this is that it's more metabolically expensive to absorb and digest fat and protein, so eating them generates more heat ([the thermic effect of food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_dynamic_action#Types_of_foods)), increases the heart rate, and will leave your stomach full for a longer period of time.

A personal favorite evening food is a cup of bone broth. It'll take away hunger and may even help with sleep due to its glycine content <sup>[1]</sup>. I've measured my own blood sugar, sleep latency, heart rate, heart rate variability, and sleep disruptions after eating large mixed meals (fat, carbohydrates, and protein) just before bedtime, and there is a major negative effect. My blood sugar stays elevated all night, my heart rate can run 10 beats higher than baseline, my heart rate variability plummets, and I can lose an additional 20-30 minutes of sleep over the course of the night in disruptions. There are several other reasons not to eat close to bedtime that are outside the scope of this article<sup>[2]</sup>.

### Sound

I try to keep it quiet but I actually prefer a bit of white noise which I get from a ceiling fan and an air filter. As an aside, I'm always shocked when I change the filter - bedroom fabrics, pillows, towels, tissues, and carpets produce a seemingly endless supply of dust.

### Caffeine

I have tried to eliminate caffeine almost completely from my diet. When I do choose to drink coffee (which I love), I consume as little as possible and as early as possible in the day.

Some people are slow metabolizers and may still have some circulating caffeine late at night even after a single morning or midday coffee. You may not feel the effects of the caffeine, but that doesn't mean that it isn't keeping you awake. Try to cut back on the quantity and have it as early as possible. If you can stop drinking coffee (and other sources of caffeine) by 9 or 10 am, or earlier, that is ideal. If you find yourself tired in the early afternoon the first couple days, give it a few more days to see if getting more sleep makes up for the decrease in caffeine.

I reliably have a delayed sleep cycle if I drink more than half of a cup of coffee in the morning. Instead of feeling tired around eight or nine PM, I'm wide awake until midnight or later.

### Exercise

I try to perform high intensity workouts early in the day. Even low intensity workouts close to bedtime raise my body temperature and delay my sleep onset. Many people find that high-intensity workouts in the evening keep them up later. I sometimes break my own rule on this one and I usually pay the price.

### Supplements

If you do most of the other things properly most of the time, you probably won't need medications or supplements, almost ever. That said, sometimes you want to ensure a good night's sleep as much as possible, and supplements might help. For those nights, I think [Doc Parsley's Sleep Remedy](https://store.docparsley.com/products/sleep-remedy) is likely safe and effective. It contains a small dose of melatonin which is meant to help with sleep initiation, serotonin, phosphatidylserine, magnesium, and vitamin D. I think it's possible that the serotonin, phosphatidylserine, and magnesium may help with reducing stress and anxiety and therefore may assist with sleep initiation. I am uncertain as to why the vitamin D is included, but I think it's very unlikely to be harmful, and may be helpful for the many people who are vitamin D deficient.
