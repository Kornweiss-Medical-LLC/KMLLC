### History and Diagnosis

On October 25, 2020, I was seated at my desk at work and noticed a vague but unusual sensation in my abdomen; a few sharp pains cascaded across my lower abdomen and then vanished. It was 10 AM. I evaluated several patients who were waiting for me, and then I ate breakfast and drank coffee.

At 11 AM, I noticed a few mild cramps in my right lower abdomen. I believed this was merely a signal to use the restroom, which I did. Immediately afterwards, I felt a right-sided, sudden, deep, and lancing pain in my pelvis that gradually faded to a dull ache. It was at this time that I believed something might be wrong.

I resumed work, but a few minutes later when I noted that the pain had not receded, I was compelled to examine my own abdomen. I laid flat on a stretcher, and pressed deeply over the right lower part of my abdomen. I encountered a small tender area between my umbilicus (belly button) and my right groin, a point known by medical professionals as "McBurney's Point." 

![McBurney's Point](images/fowler_mcburneys_point.png)
Fowler, George Ryerson. 1900. A Treatise on Appendicitis. J.B. Lippincott. P. 171.

I surveyed myself and noted the absence of any other symptoms. I did not have nausea, fever, a loss of appetite, or malaise. Besides the pain, which had now dulled, I felt normal. I moved my leg back and forth, walked, squatted, extended at the hip, and I felt no worsening of the pain.

I visited several patients, hoping that the pain would subside. When it didn't, I reexamined myself; the tenderness persisted. I announced my diagnosis of appendicitis to my colleagues. After each performed their own visual survey, noting my upright posture and relaxed facial expression, I was met with raised eyebrows that communicated their collective skepticism.

I worked for five more hours. The pain persisted, but it was quite mild. I felt only a vague dull ache and a sense of heaviness in the right lower part of my abdomen. I felt better when seated, and when I walked, I did not feel pain, but I noticed that I preferred to lean and bend slightly to the right. Walking, rocking back and forth, and bouncing up and down did not increase the pain as it often does in patients with appendicitis. Occasionally, I felt a lancing pain deep within my right pelvis that referred to my bladder and rectum. These shooting pains lasted only for an instant, but they were sufficiently disturbing so as to send waves of cold chills across my skin. I felt a vague sense of terror, which I quickly realized was due to my conscious fear of being ill, and from the knowledge that I might shortly be in the operating room undergoing surgery.

After performing my clinical duties, I proceeded to perform an ultrasound of my own abdomen. The moment I placed the ultrasound probe over the area of tenderness, I visualized a black circle circumscribing a white circle which contained a white dome with black shadowing. 

![Appendix Ultrasound](images/appendix_ultrasound.jpg)

I knew this likely represented a loop of bowel containing a hard substance all surrounded by fluid; in other words, I believed I had found an inflamed appendix harboring a stone, called an appendicolith (appendico-lith means, literally, appendix-stone -- appendicoliths typically form when stool enters the appendix and remains stuck there long enough for some hardening and calcification to occur). The appendix is a small loop, or pouch, with a blind end. I followed the loop back and forth with the ultrasound probe, it seemed to end rather than continue on. I now felt my diagnosis inescapable.

Appendicitis is a condition in which the appendix becomes inflamed, and if left untreated, can often rupture, and cause a very serious infection inside of a patient's abdomen, which can result in severe illness and even death, though in countries with modern medicine, death is extraordinarily rare even in cases of rupture. The treatment for appendicitis is usually surgical removal of the appendix. In some cases, appendicitis can be treated with antibiotics alone. As a physician with a healthy fear of surgery, I wanted to have as much confirmation of the diagnosis as possible before making a treatment decision (In addition, most surgeons prefer that a CT scan demonstrate a clear diagnosis of appendicitis before operation - especially in vague cases).

I was able to obtain a CT scan which confirmed my diagnosis. Not only was my appendix enlarged and inflamed, there was, in fact, an appendicolith within the middle of my appendix.

### Treatment / Surgery

After the diagnosis was confirmed, I decided to have my appendix removed surgically. Prior to this ordeal, I had always thought that if I had appendicitis, I would choose antibiotics over surgery, but once I learned that my appendix was obstructed by a stone, I decided that the risk of antibiotics failing, and my appendix subsequently rupturing, outweighed the risk of surgery.

If the appendix ruptures, stool and infectious material leak into the abdominal cavity often causing an abscess to form. This usually requires hospitalization and surgical drains, as well as prolonged courses of antibiotics. It can also cause surgery to become more complicated. The healing process from the ruptured appendix can cause adhesions (a form of internal scarring) to form around the bowels, which can lead to future bowel obstructions if loops of bowel become entangled and strangulated by the adhesions. I really did not want this to happen.

On the other hand, I also did not want to lose my appendix. Most people believe that the appendix serves no known function. I remember being taught about vestigial organs in middle school. The appendix was used as an example. But, the appendix may serve a role in gastrointestinal immunity. Some believe that the appendix harbors helpful bacteria that can repopulate the colon after a bout of infectious diarrhea  [^1]. The appendix is also associated with immune tissue that some believe is an integral part of gastrointestinal immunity. Additionally, at least one study has found an association between appendectomy and an increased risk of colorectal cancer [[2]], while another did not [[3]]. Despite these concerns, 5-10% of Americans will undergo appendectomy every year, and these individuals seem to do quite well on the average. The last concern, which goes for any surgery, is of course the risk of surgical complications.

In my experience, most surgeons will lean heavily towards recommending surgery over antibiotics. Surgery is considered the definitive treatment, but there is evidence that uncomplicated cases in which the appendix is not obstructed or severely inflamed, that antibiotics may be a viable treatment option. It's worth discussing before committing to surgery if circumstances permit.

I was brought to the pre-operative area. I reflected upon my symptoms. Where was the textbook pain of appendicitis that typically starts at the umbilicus (belly button), and which gradually migrates to the right lower quadrant? As I thought, I recalled the prior two nights. At the time, I thought nothing of it, but I remembered that the night before, I had been pushing on my umbilicus reflexively. I made nothing of it at the time. Even now, I would not describe the sensation I felt as pain, just perhaps a vague and fleeting ache. I did also have a burning epigastric pain two nights prior, which I thought was acid reflux. This burning lasted an hour or two, but subsided. I've had indigestion on several occasions, but in reflection, this was more painful than any prior episodes. I had awoken multiple times the two preceding nights feeling overheated and restless. I was never nauseated. I did not vomit. I did not feel as though I had a fever or chills, but in retrospect, there were signs that likely marked the beginning of the inflammatory process.

As I finished my reflecting, the anesthetist entered. While surgery is performed by a surgeon, the surgeon's job would be far more difficult, and the surgery a great ordeal for the patient without the under-appreciated anesthesiologist. Before my operation, I met my anesthesiologist.

I asked her for the anesthesia plan, which included a series of medications starting with analgesics (pain medications), antiemetics (nausea medications), and followed by a sedative/anxiolytic (relaxation medications).

There are three major categories of analgesics:
    
**Narcotics**
        
This category includes medications like oxycodone, morphine, fentanyl and hydromorphone. My anesthesiologist was planning to use fentanyl. This drug works almost instantly after it's administered through an IV, but usually wears off within 30-120 minutes depending on the individual and the dose given.
    
**NSAIDS** (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)
        
This category includes medications like ibuprofen, naproxen, and ketorolac. My anesthesiologist was planning to use ketorolac. Ketorolac is an effective pain medicine that has no habit-forming (addicting) properties, and does not make the patient feel sedated in any way. It also has antiinflammatory properties. It's used frequently for renal colic (the pain from kidney stones and kidney infections), and also often for gynecologic pathology, and musculoskeletal injuries.
    
**Acetaminophen**
        
Acetaminophen, or Tylenol, is often used for analgesia and as an anti-pyretic (temperature/fever reducer). In the operating room, anesthesiologists will sometimes use intravenous Tylenol to treat pain. My anesthesiologist planned to use this as well.

I was in very little pain, and I wanted to experience post-operative pain for the purposes of educating myself and others without these medications in my system. I refused all three, but I relented on the IV Tylenol. I did not take or receive any other pain medications before, during, or after my surgery besides this one dose of IV Tylenol, nor did I feel it was necessary at any time. This may not be true for others who might have varying degrees of inflammation or a different experience with pain than I did.

There are many different antiemetic drugs. My anesthesiologist wanted to use one of the most common, which is called ondansetron (Zofran). I turned this down as well, as I did not experience any nausea. Sometimes steroid medications are used to treat nausea as well, and I did agree to receive a dose of IV dexamethasone to avoid post-anesthesia nausea.

Last, it's common to receive a dose of sedative/anxiolytic such as midazolam (also known as Versed, a member of the class of medications called benzodiazepines) pre-operatively. These drugs work similarly to alcohol on a biochemical level, and similarly result in slowed thinking, slurred speech, decreased anxiety, and eventually a sedated state. I turned this down as well, as I very much wanted the full experience of being aware of and remembering the moments leading up to general anesthesia.

So, I was not the most agreeable patient. But, when a doctor has another doctor as a patient, this is expected, within reason. If you are not a medical professional, it's likely best to trust your anesthesiologists plan and not to request changes unless there are specific reasons.

Next, my very gracious and patient anesthesiologist explained that I would undergo general anesthesia. This means I would be fully unconscious. There are many medications that can render a patient completely unconscious, but one of the most common is a drug familiar to those who remember Michael Jackson's tragic death. This drug is called propofol. When used in proper doses under monitored circumstances, or in the context of general anesthesia when the patient will be connected to a ventilator, this is actually an incredibly safe drug with a nearly non-existent side-effect profile. The medication itself has a unique appearance. It is a milky white substance. The drug mixture has this appearance because the drug itself is lipophilic. Remember from high-school chemistry and biology that this means the chemical is "fat loving," it dissolves well in fat. The mixture is a lipid emulsion (just like a hollandaise sauce) the drug is dissolved with a fatty liquid that looks like milk.

![Propofol](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Pofol.JPG)

The drug is given through an IV line, and its ability to dissolve well in fat allows it to very rapidly cross into brain tissue and bind to receptors that render the patient unconscious (these receptors are again the same kind that are affected by drinking alcohol - GABA receptors).

Depending on the dose of the drug given, the patient may continue to breathe on their own, even though they are completely unconscious. Next, a paralytic drug is delivered through the IV which stops the patient from moving and relaxes all of their muscles. This is very good for surgery, because it prevents the patient from moving while the surgeon is operating, but, it also stops the patient from breathing by paralyzing the muscles of the thorax, including the diaphragm, which are responsible for breathing. To address this problem, and for another reason I'll explain momentarily, the anesthesiologist has to breathe for the patient.

A laryngoscope (a special tool that opens the patient's airway) is used to assist with the insertion of an endotracheal tube (a plastic tube that goes inside the trachea). Once the tube is in place, it's connected to an anesthesia machine. This machine is a special ventilator which allows the anesthesiologist to control the breathing rate, depth of the breath, and the amount of oxygen going to the patient. The machine can also deliver inhaled anesthetics, which are used to keep the patient unconscious throughout the procedure. The propofol which is given initially is quickly distributed away from the brain, and then metabolized by the liver, so that, unless it is given continuously, or in repeat doses, the patient would otherwise regain consciousness within several minutes depending on the dose and patient specific conditions such as weight and metabolic rate. Another reason to place a breathing tube during surgery, is to prevent (WARNING - GRAPHIC DESCRIPTION) the patient from aspirating their own vomitus while they're unconscious. Endotracheal tubes have special balloons that separate the airway from the esophagus, so that if the patient vomits, it can't get into the lungs.

Because I didn't accept any sedatives in the pre-op area, I remember being wheeled in to the OR, talking to my OR team, and breathing in oxygen and inhaled anesthetic through the mask. I remember being dosed with propofol. The next thing I remember is waking up in the post-op area. This is the goal of the anesthesiologist; to keep the patient alive throughout surgery and to make sure they don't remember anything that happened. This is easier said than done, though experienced anesthetists certainly make it look easy.

In the emergency department, we use similar medications for bedside procedures, but we must be cautious with our dosing, because we do not endeavor to connect our patients to ventilators. So, we must dose medications adequately to ensure patient comfort, but not to the degree that they cease to breathe spontaneously.

While I was asleep, my surgeon carried out a laparoscopic appendectomy.

He first made an incision on my abdominal wall just beneath my umbilicus (belly button). He then dissected down through the fat until he reached the peritoneum (this is a layer of tissue that encloses the abdominal cavity and all of the organs inside).

![Peritoneum Gray's 1040](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Gray1040.png)

Usually, the surgeon will lift upward on the peritoneum and make a tiny incision, large enough to insert a hollow plastic tube, called a port. Through the port he can insert a camera, and a machine that insufflates (inflates) the abdominal cavity with air. The abdomen inflates upwards like a balloon, making space between the abdominal wall and the bowels and organs so that the surgeon can insert tools and have space to work. Two more holes are made in the abdominal wall for a total of three. This makes room for a camera and two tools. Usually, an assistant manages the camera while the surgeon operates the tools.

Blunt graspers are used to move the bowels in order to expose the appendix, which in my case was anterior, superficial, pointing downwards and located within the peritoneum - closest to letter A below.

![Appendix Anatomic Variants](images/appendiceal_anatomic_variants.png)
Fowler, George Ryerson. 1900. A Treatise on Appendicitis. J.B. Lippincott. P. 29

Lucky for me, this is ideal. It means that the appendix is easily found, easily visualized, and less likely to cause complications. The appendix can point in almost any direction up, down, to either side, and it can be partially located behind the colon and partially or fully outside of the peritoneal cavity. All of these variations could make surgery slightly more complicated than was my case.

Once the appendix is located, the surgeon still has to separate it from any adjacent loops of bowel and connective tissue by cauterizing (burning) and pulling it away. Once the appendix is fully dissected and separated from other tissues, it can be cut away from the bowel. This can be done in numerous ways, but most commonly it is now done using a tool that cauterizes the bowel and delivers a line of special staples across the base of the appendix. This simultaneously separates the appendix from the bowel and closes the remaining appendiceal stump all at once.

Then, the appendix is removed through one of the three ports, the abdomen deflated, the ports removed, the tiny incisions (each about an inch long) are closed with suture and glue, and the surgery is concluded.

As the procedure is nearing its end, the surgeon will notify the anesthetist who will turn off the inhaled anesthetic and administer an IV drug to reverse the paralysis. Once the patient is breathing on their own, the anesthetist will remove the breathing tube. This is an extremely important and delicate process that anesthetists do routinely, but which is not to be taken for granted.

Once the patient is extubated (breathing tube is removed) they are brought to the post-op area where nurses will monitor the patient until they have been stable for 30-60 minutes.

In my case, I went home after this monitoring period. I was mildly sore, but completely lucid, and felt very well rested.

### Post Operative Period

**Week 1**

On post-operative day one, my abdomen was significantly distended to the point of feeling taught. I did not have a lot of pain, but I felt very uncomfortably bloated. I could not wear any of my usual clothing. Sitting up and down was difficult. I had to use my arms to push me up from a seated position. Instinctively, I did not want to attempt any abdominal contraction. I had little appetite, and I had to remind myself to eat small amounts of food (I'll give details below) and to drink water with stool softener. I did have pain underneath my right trapezius muscle, which is referred pain from distension and trapped air under the diaphragm from surgery. This subsided by the beginning of day two.

Day two was similar to day one. I slept a lot, and watched a lot of television. I attempted read and write, but I was both mentally and physically exhausted, and succumbed to exhaustion within minutes of opening my computer. Despite the exhaustion, I did wrench myself from the couch for 30-40 minutes to walk each day.

On day three, I was able to eat a bit more, and bowel function returned, though not normal.

For the next four days, I nursed myself back to health. I checked my incisions every day for signs of infection, like worsening pain, redness, or tenderness. I took pictures of them daily so that I could compare one day to the next. I actually used these pictures on day 6 when I had increased pain at one incision and I thought its color had reddened, but when I compared it to the pictures from all prior days, it actually looked improved, so I continued to monitor the incision until it gradually healed completely.

My incisions were closed at the skin with glue, so there were no visible sutures. The incisions were firm to the touch, tender, purple and yellow from bruising, and especially the incision around my umbilicus was swollen and the skin surrounding my umbilicus was firm in an area the size of my palm. This improved very gradually.

I did not take any medication at all. I chose to avoid NSAIDs like ibuprofen because there is some evidence in animal studies and also good mechanistic evidence that they may slow wound healing, and can slow healing of bowel anastomoses. This may be more relevant for more serious surgeries, but I wanted every chance to optimize healing.

Eventually, I received a message from the hospital. A pathologist examined my appendix. It's routine for the surgeon to send surgical specimens for pathologic examination. There are several reasons for doing this. In cases of appendicitis, it's important both to confirm the diagnosis, and to look for other diagnoses such as appendiceal cancers, which do occur from time to time. Pathologists are specially trained doctors who examine biopsies (tissue samples) and who also perform whole autopsies (examination of the deceased) to find out what is (or was) wrong. The pathologist determined that I definitely had appendicitis. This determination was made by looking at the appendix with the naked eye, and by examining thin slices of the appendix under a microscope.

**Week 2**

By day eight, I was able to work. However, my abdomen still felt slightly swollen and heavy, and I had sharp pains deep within my pelvis every one or two hours that were similar to the pains I had before surgery. While disturbing, and worrisome, these pains were intermittent, and I felt better overall. I did not have any fevers, nausea, vomiting, or worsening pain. This improved a little bit each day.

I was worried on day ten when I continued to have right lower quadrant pains and tenderness, so I visited my primary doctor for an evaluation. He examined me and agreed that I was in fact still quite tender. He ordered labs which included a CBC and a CRP (c-reactive protein - a very sensitive marker of inflammation). We also ran a urinalysis and a liver function panel. All labs were completely normal, with an incredibly low CRP of 0.01, which is the lowest possible value. With a value this low, the chance of an ongoing infection or surgical complication is incredibly low. This data, combined with my improving symptoms was reassuring.

**Week 3**

In week three, the symptoms were 95% resolved. The glue holding my incisions closed had naturally fallen off. There is still firmness around the incisions, but only in the immediate vicinity, and it is not painful to the touch. I am nearing complete recovery from surgery.

### My Recovery Regimen

There are a few trite recommendations that you'll hear doctors enumerate for nearly every condition. They're also the same things you'll hear from your family and friends. These recommendations are so general and commonplace, that they're often under-weighted or ignored completely, but they shouldn't be.

How many times have you been told to "get plenty of rest, drink lots of water, and be active, but not too active?"

Because this advice is repeated so often, and is usually unquantified, it sounds unimportant, but it is crucial.

**Sleep**
I did sleep a lot. I slept more than fourteen hours the first day after surgery, and twelve hours the next. I slept at least eight hours a night for the next two or three days after that. I didn't aim to sleep any particular amount, but I did not limit my sleep the way I often do with imposed schedules and alarms.

**Hydration**
I hydrated by drinking enough to produce clear light-yellow urine every 2-4 hours while awake. If frequency decreased, or the urine darkened, I drank more. Hydrating cannot be done with just plain water, especially when you are not eating sufficient food and electrolytes, which is common during illness or after surgery. Hydration is best achieved with adequate salt (sodium-chloride) intake. Other electrolytes like potassium and magnesium can be helpful as well. There are many excellent [oral rehydration solutions](https://amzn.to/36Daw8K) and mixes on the market - I prefer those without added sugar.

**Activity**
It's extremely important to walk after surgery. I really didn't feel like getting off of the couch. I forced myself to walk 30-60 minutes per day anyway. Walking helps recover bowel function, it also decreases the risk of developing blood clots and pneumonia, and it can prevent a decline in cardiopulmonary fitness. I was shocked by my degree of exhaustion and how quickly I became de-trained after surgery. During the first week, I felt exhausted after just 20-30 minutes of walking at a slow pace. I gradually improved. I believe I'd be worse off had I not walked regularly and increasingly as my improvement allowed.

If you've had surgery, you'll know that you are usually given certain lifting and movement restrictions. I was restricted to lifting five pounds for the first two weeks, for example, and then given a taper of lifting restrictions until I can resume unlimited activity eight weeks after my surgery. These restrictions are not arbitrary, they are to prevent sutures from tearing through the thin tissues that line the abdominal cavity, and thus to prevent hernias and other complications. Following these restrictions to the letter is prudent if you are to avoid repeated surgery.

**Nutrition**
I focused on avoiding sugar of all kinds and processed foods for fear that hyperglycemia and oxidative stress might slow wound healing and increase the risk of infections. 

Instead I focused on eating nutrient dense real whole foods like meat, fish, vegetables, and a little bit of fruit (I prefer berries like blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries, which have relatively little sugar compared to fruits like apples, bananas, strawberries, and melons). Broth, in particular bone broth made from real bones and connective tissue is one of my staples even when I am healthy. I find it to be an excellent means of consuming protein and hydrating simultaneously. It may also be the case that the particular mix of amino acids in broths favor the development of healthy connective tissue, which is exactly what your body needs to regenerate after surgery. By skimming more or less fat from the top of the broth you can modulate the energy content of the broth. I use pork and beef bones, and I like to consume all of the fat. I added salt, meat, rice, and, vegetables to my broth in increasing amounts each day after surgery. I also ate scrambled eggs and avocado.

**Bowel Regimen**
My surgeon recommended Miralax (polyethylene glycol) - which is an osmotic laxative. It's an inert substance that passes through the bowel unabsorbed. As it passes through the colon, it binds to water and holds that water in the colon, which might otherwise have been absorbed. This action of maintaining more water in the colon keeps stool soft, and makes it easier to move the bowels. The importance of this both from a standpoint of recovery and comfort cannot be emphasized enough. I drank 20 ounces of water with a cap full (17 grams) of [Miralax](https://amzn.to/3pLe3uy) each morning and each evening. This worked beautifully.

I will also take this opportunity to recommend a product called the [Squatty Potty](https://amzn.to/32OBPvy), which is a special stool that helps put you in a proper position on the toilet. The squat position is essential for reducing the "anal angle" to reduce straining and its downstream effects which can include an incomplete evacuation, the development of diverticular disease, and hemorrhoids, both internal and external.

### Reflections
    
**Being a doctor doesn't make being a patient any less frightening.**
    
Having surgery was, and still is, one of my biggest fears. As an emergency physician, I only see patients after an operation if something goes wrong. Most patients do not have complications from surgery, because most surgeons are very good at what they do. These patients do not come to the ER, because they do well and follow-up in surgery clinics. I only see patients who do poorly, and so, my professional view of surgery is colored in this way. 
    
I know that an appendectomy is one of the simplest operations, and that mine in particular was extremely straightforward. But, I cannot help but think that every post-op twinge and pain is from an abscess, a hernia, or some other disaster that will ultimately lead to complication after complication. Because of my profession, I can quite rapidly invoke mental images of cascades of surgical and medical disasters resulting in my disability or demise. For those who work outside the medical profession, the terror might be even worse, because the unknown can be scariest of all. I can make reasonable interpretations of my pain. But for those without medical training, the imagination could run wild. Doctors do well when they recognize that most patients just want to understand what's going on. People don't expect miracles and omniscience, but they do expect reasonable explanations of diagnoses and best guesses at prognosis.
    
**The diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis seems routine, but it's complex, and not to be taken for granted.**
    
There were six doctors involved in my care, two CT technologists, at least six nurses, and several other assistants. Each doctor goes through at least seven years of post graduate training (after college) in many cases it's actually nine years or more. Nurses go through nursing school. Technologists have specialized training as well. Modern technological marvels like CT scanners, which are now common place even in the smallest hospitals, were not widely available at all hours of the day in most hospitals just fifty years ago. Even when they were available, wait times were much longer, image quality much poorer, radiologists less available, and thus the liklihood of a missed, uncertain, or delayed diagnosis by today's standards was much higher. 
    
Today, we can usually obtain CT scans within an hour of a patient entering one of our ER rooms and have a report thirty minutes later. That is truly unbelievable. Consider the IV contrast media that is injected into your veins which enables the radiologist to see areas of increased and decreased blood flow and thus to find pathological inflammation, or in other cases, blood clots, for example. This contrast media has been improved over the years to decrease allergic reactions, to decrease harm to the kidneys, and in almost every case, this chemical which lights up brightly on CT scans, passes harmlessly through your body and is urinated into the toilet. This is taken completely for granted, but not that long ago, it was common that this contrast media would do harm to your body. And, prior to that, it didn't exist at all.
    
Blood work is usually resulted within thirty minutes of hitting the lab. The lab alone is a modern marvel with machines that can process tens or hundreds of blood samples in the time it would have taken a human to manually process a single sample.
    
In addition to the training and technology, it's easy to forget about the continuing education that physicians complete on a regular basis, and the case discussions that take place between colleagues. Physicians are constantly working to become better diagnosticians; to make every last diagnosis. As a testament to this, consider that in researching this article, I read a Treatise on Appendicitis that was written in 1900. In this treatise, I learned that in certain anatomic variants, the cecum (the part of the bowel that joins the small and large bowels), can sometimes be located near the midline of the abdomen instead of in the right lower quadrant. In these cases, the appendix can project across the midline, and cause pain on the left side of the abdomen. I was not taught about this in school or in training at any time (at least not that I remember).
    
In addition to the diagnostic knowledge and technology that consistently improves, consider the hospital facility which has to be built efficiently and maintained by dozens or hundreds of staff members. Consider the sterile processing department, an oft forgotten department that ensures the sterility of every tool that goes inside of your body during surgery. Consider the purchasing department which ensures the surgeon has the proper suture material, and that the proper medications are available for the anesthesiologist. Consider the pharmacy, where more trained professionals work to purchase, mix, dispense, and monitor the medications being delivered to hundreds of patients throughout the hospital. And, don't forget the hospital administrators who manage and oversee the operation, and make strategic decisions to ensure that the hospital can continue to pay the salaries of its many workers and to stay open to treat its many paying customers.
    
The patient doesn't see most of these people and doesn't have any idea what goes on in these departments. It's easy for medical professionals to take them for granted too.
    
But, we shouldn't, because tiny mistakes in diagnosis or treatment, or just bad luck, such as an allergy to a medication, can cause injury or death. If someone doesn't follow proper sterile processing procedures, or doesn't measure medications properly in the pharmacy, serious complications can occur. It takes a huge group of highly trained experts who stand on the shoulders of the brilliant men and women who came before us to run a safe and effective hospital.
    
**It feels bad when your doctor doesn't listen to you.**
    
I left this out of the story, but while I was working, I told a colleague that I thought I had appendicitis and asked him to examine me. He did not think that I had appendicitis because I wasn't in very much pain, and I wasn't very tender on my examination. I caught a glimpse of what it would feel like to be disregarded by your physician. In my case, it didn't matter much, because I was both patient and doctor, and I was fairly certain of my own diagnosis. And, in all fairness to this other doctor, he knew from the outset that I was going to have a CT scan. So, this is not a true example of a patient being ignored by his doctor, but it was enough to give me a slice of the experience. It was a good reminder that, doctors, like everyone else, sometimes don't listen adequately. When a patient tells me something is wrong, I believe them, and now with renewed vigor. Mistakes, misdiagnoses, and missed diagnoses can happen no matter how hard a doctor tries, but the majority are avoidable by merely listening intently to patients.

[Sir William Osler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Osler), Canadian Physician, one of four founding professors of Johns Hopkins Hospital, who has frequently been described as the Father of Modern Medicine and one of the "greatest diagnosticians ever to wield a stethoscope." [[4]], said "Listen to your patient, he is telling you the diagnosis." In my case, this was literally true. But, when Osler said this, what he meant was that when patients describe their symptoms, they are giving the doctor clues to their diagnosis. It is the doctor's job to listen very carefully, to interpret what the patient says, and most of all, to think deeply. The physician who disregards or fails to hear a patient's symptoms puts both the patient and themselves in great peril.
    
**Doctors are human.**
    
I did not know my anesthesiologist, nurses, or surgeon very well before surgery, but I did know them a little bit, and I believe that I likely enjoyed an extra degree of attentiveness and care on their part as a result of being their colleague and of generally being reasonably well liked (to the best of my knowledge). Most medical professionals work attentively and professionally regardless of who the patient is, but it is undeniable that being in the good graces of your medical team is better than the alternative. Suffice it to say, you do not want an adversarial relationship with your nurse or your doctor. At the very least, any interpersonal strain between a patient and their medical team could detract time and energy from the team who would otherwise be focused solely on delivering the best possible medical care.
    
**Good health begets good health.**

I reinforced what I already knew about health. One important reason to optimize my health on a daily basis is to cope with unexpected challenges like this. I thought because of my good nutrition, metabolic, and gastrointestinal health that I would never have appendicitis. But, I got it anyway. As it turns out, the majority of people who develop appendicitis actually report having regular bowels. The good news is that my body was prepared for an insult. What if I had not been in good health? What might have been different?

I may not have been able to examine my abdomen or ultrasound it easily if I was not reasonably thin, which might have delayed my diagnosis. A delayed diagnosis could have resulted in a ruptured appendix. It would have been more difficult for the nurse to insert an IV to draw blood and administer medications if I did not have lean arms and well hydrated veins. My surgeon may have had more trouble accessing my abdomen to perform surgery, and the operation may have been more difficult if I had more visceral fat (fat around my bowels and internal organs). My wounds and bowels might have recovered more slowly if I had poor nutrition, ongoing inflammation, or an inability to be active after surgery.  I might have suffered a wound infection if I had high blood sugar levels, or unhealthy blood vessels. I might have developed pneumonia or blood clots. My anesthesiologist might have had more difficulty placing a breathing tube and dosing my anesthesia. I might have stayed in the operating room longer and in the hospital longer to recover from anesthesia if I was overweight (some anesthetics are absorbed by fat cells and take longer to leave the body of patients with more fat tissue). Poor nutritional status and lack of abdominal wall musculature could predispose to hernias that could require a second operation.

I could go on with these examples. The point is, if there is no other reason, consider optimizing your health because, one day it may mean the difference between life and death when you require a routine operation, or contract an infection like Covid-19 or the next strain of influenza.
