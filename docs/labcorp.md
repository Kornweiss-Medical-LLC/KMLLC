# Labcorp Instructions

**Schedule an Appointment**

Choose a Labcorp Patient Service Center and schedule an appointment (https://www.labcorp.com/labs-and-appointments).

*Note: Do not go as a walk-in, you will likely have a long wait.*

**What to Bring**
- Identification
- Requisition form (either printed or digital).
- I typically send these to you as an email attachment. This should be sufficient.

**Fast for at least 13 hours (no coffee)**

Fast for at least 13 hours prior to your blood draw unless I explicitly tell you that you don't need to fast. You may have water only during this time period. Even black coffee can elevate triglycerides in some individuals.

**First Timers**

If this is your first time doing a blood draw with me, especially if you’re a new patient, you may be surprised by the number of vials. I order comprehensive testing for new clients, and it may require 9-12 vials of blood. If you’ve never donated blood or had a blood draw like this before, it can cause discomfort or lightheadedness even for people who typically don’t have trouble with blood draws. I apologize in advance. If you think this will be intolerable, we can split the order into two or more smaller orders.

**Client Bill vs. Insurance Bill**

I usually order labs as “client bill,” which means that I will pay the Labcorp bill and pass the charge through to your account (no markup). This charge will be added to your regular monthly invoice. If we decided on insurance bill, you’ll receive a bill from your insurance company.

**Results**

Your results will be accessible via the [Labcorp Patient Portal](https://patient.labcorp.com/). Some tests may result within one or two days. Others may take several days or even longer than a week.
