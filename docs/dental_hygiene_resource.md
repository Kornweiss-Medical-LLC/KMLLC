# Dental Hygiene Recommendations

## Protocol
- Brushing: 2-3 times daily
	- Brush at least twice daily, once upon awakening and once before bed.
- Floss: 1-2 times daily
	- Flossing in the morning upon awakening is useful even if food was cleaned out the night before. Both brushing and flossing disrupt biofilms and decrease bacterial growth.
	- If you only floss once, make it before you go to bed at night. It's essential not to go to sleep with food in the pocket between teeth and gums.
- Brush, floss, or rinse with water after meals
- Professional Cleaning: 3-4 times yearly
- Optional: water-pick, rinse/mouthwash before bed
	- Rinsing with antibacterial mouthwash (like those listed above) can be beneficial but does not replace brushing and flossing, which is required to mechanically disturb and limit biofilm growth.

## Toothbrush
- Electric recommended
