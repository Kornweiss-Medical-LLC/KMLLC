# You Cannot Rely on Your Normal A1c to Rule-Out Diabetes

Type II diabetes is defined as a disease of impaired glucose metabolism and is characterized by hyperglycemia. The first definition of diabetic diagnostic criteria were put forth by an expert committee who convened in Geneva in 1965. Their findings were published in a World Health Organization Report.

The committee recommended the following diagnostic criteria for diabetes:
- 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) > 140 mg/dl OR
- Fasting blood glucose greater than 130 mg/dl 

Just like today, these diagnostic criteria offer hard cutoffs for the diagnosis of diabetes. Which means, if a patient had a fasting blood glucose of 129, they do not meet the diagnostic criteria for diabetes. But, if that same patient were to come back the following day with a fasting blood glucose of 131, the do meet the diagnostic criteria for diabetes.

All numeric tests have recommended cut-points to distinguish “normal” from “abnormal.” But, we also know that physiology is not discrete, it varies from person to person, and it’s dynamic. This means that no test threshold is perfect for a given individual at a given time. The test result must be interpreted carefully and within the context of the individual patient.

Furthermore, even if an individual clearly does not meet diagnostic criteria for diabetes, that does not mean they aren’t well on their way. It’s estimated that the pathophysiology that leads to type II diabetes can begin developing at least two decades in advance of a patient meeting diagnostic criteria for the disease.

The expert committee in 1965 was aware of these issues.

> “Many persons are in the border-line state between the values given in the accompanying table for normality and diabetes. The Committee urged all physicians and health authorities to pay special attention to this group, who will yield a high proportion of diabetics and for whom preventive measures will be most rewarding.”

> “Appreciating the magnitude of the health problem created by the progressive increase in the prevalence of diabetes in all parts of the world, and realizing that overt manifestations of the disease may be a late feature, the Committee was of the opinion that the participation of the public health authorities and other agencies in early case detection is essential.”

It’s clear that experts in diabetes even in the 60s were aware that diabetes is a major problem and that it’s a challenge to make the diagnosis early before overt disease.

Despite these prescient observations and recommendations, diagnostic criteria for diabetes have been anything but progressive. Only in 2021 did the United States Preventive Services Taskforce recommend screening all individuals at age 35 (the previous recommendations were age 45). The diagnostic criteria still depend on dichotomous thresholds of fasting glucose, OGTT results, and now, hemoglobin A1c.

As of 2009, the International Expert Committee presented the A1c as an option for screening for diabetes. Prior to that time, only fasting plasma glucose and an oral glucose tolerance test were recommended. This is because of the known insensitivity with the A1c test for detecting diabetes.

> “The A1C test, with a diagnostic threshold of 6.5% (48 mmol/mol), diagnoses only 30% of the diabetes cases identified collectively using A1C, FPG, or 2-h PG, according to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data (29). Despite these limitations with A1C, in 2009 the International Expert Committee added A1C to the diagnostic criteria with the goal of increased screening (21).”

Here are the 2022 diagnostic criteria for type II diabetes according to The American Diabetes Association (ADA):
- Fasting plasma glucose greater than 126 mg/dl OR
- 2-hour OGTT greater than 200 mg/dl OR
- Hemoglobin A1c greater than 6.5% OR
- In a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, a random plasma glucose greater than 200 mg/dL

As you can see, these diagnostic criteria are nearly identical to those created in 1965, with the exception of the hemoglobin A1c.

Despite the fact that the A1c is the least sensitive method of screening for diabetes, it has become the most popular 
In the past several decades, however, the A1c has become the favored test for screening for diabetes for several reasons:

1. **Convenience**

An A1c can be evaluated from a standard tube of blood. It’s a relatively inexpensive test. The results come back quickly.

2. **Ease of Interpretation**

Even though interpretation of an A1c requires nuance, it’s clinically defensible for physicians to interpret this test based on published guidelines. What I mean is that my A1c of 5.6% may not mean the same thing that my friend’s A1c of 5.6% means. My average glucose, glucose peaks, and glucose tolerance might be significantly different than his, but we could still have the same A1c for a variety of reasons. Nonetheless, our physician will interpret them the same way. She will say that both of us are normal. The published criteria for pre-diabetes is 5.7% and for diabetes is 6.5%.

3. **The Use of This Test is Supported by Professional Guidelines**

To quote directly from the 2022 ADA guidelines, “Generally, FPG, 2-h PG during 75-g OGTT, and A1C are equally appropriate for diagnostic screening.”

The ADA does note that these tests are not equivalent and may perform differently in different individuals. But, nonetheless, they do support any of the three tests for the purposes of diagnostic screening for type II diabetes.

According to a study conducted in 2019 by Enron et al., out of 12,772 patients in the Blue Care Network of Michigan who were eligible to be screened for diabetes, 9,941 were tested with a glucose level, an A1c or an OGTT. Of these roughly 10,000 patients who were screened, 86% were tested with a glucose level, and the other 14% were screened with an A1c. Only 11 patients (not percent) out of the 10,000 patients were screened with an oral-glucose tolerance test.

Let me reiterate that. Out of 12,772 patients in a major health insurance network in Michigan, only 11 patients were tested with an OGTT over a 3 year time period.

Out of the 8,264 patients who received a glucose level, only 14% were fasting plasma glucose levels, rendering the other 86% irrelevant for the purposes of screening for type II diabetes.

The rest of the patients who were screened were tested with an A1c. Of the 1,196 patients screened with an A1c, 752 had results that were ≥5.7%, but only 538 patients, or 72% of those were diagnosed with dysglycemia, pre-diabetes, or diabetes. This means that 28% of these patients were not given a diagnosis based on their abnormal A1c test result.

If we consider that most patients aren’t screened, that those screened with an A1c are often not given a proper diagnosis or follow-up, and further, that as many as 70% of patients with a normal A1c have insulin resistance, pre-diabetes, or even diabetes, we are failing to diagnose people with this disease process almost entirely.

In my clinical experience, this disease is diagnosed when an A1c is ≥6.5% or when a patient has marked clinical symptoms.

However, it’s well known that the pathophysiology that leads to type II diabetes begins decades before a patient will be diagnosed with an abnormal A1c, an elevated fasting plasma glucose, or even with an abnormal OGTT. Before any of these become abnormal, a patient will first have elevated insulin levels in the blood (hyperinsulinemia).

The initial pathophysiology of type II diabetes is not hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia is actually a late finding. The first abnormality in that occurs on the way to type II diabetes is hyperinsulinemia. Insulin is the hormone that is released by the pancreas in response to energy consumption. In particular, when carbohydrates are consumed, the pancreas responds by releasing insulin. Insulin has a multitude of effects on different organs and cell-types, but it’s primary effects include:

- telling the liver to stop gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis so that the liver does not release any additional glucose into circulation
- telling the liver, muscle, and other cell types to open channels to allow glucose to pass from the bloodstream into the cell
- stimulating glycogen synthesis within the liver, muscle, and other cells in order to store glucose in an efficient manner, as a lattice-like polymer of glucose molecules

You might be wondering now why we don’t simply test insulin levels instead of glucose levels in order to screen for type II diabetes. Well, this is exactly what I do, in addition to other tests, but the reasons it’s not done routinely are numerous.

A little bit of history is instructive in understanding why insulin levels are not measured more frequently. It was not even possible to measure insulin levels until a genius named Rosalyn Yalow pioneered the method of radioimmunoassay in 1956 for which she won the Nobel Prize in 1977. This technique allowed scientists to measure very small molecules which exist in low concentrations. Yalow’s test was the first which could reliably measure insulin levels. Using her test, she observed that people with type II diabetes produce more insulin than their non-diabetic counterparts. Amazingly, she correctly interpreted this to mean that type II diabetes is a disease marked by a decreased ability to use insulin. Today, this is termed insulin resistance, and it’s the precursor to the hyperglycemia that we (unfortunately) still use to screen for the condition.

Measuring insulin was not easy to do or widely available until perhaps the 1970s or 1980s. Even then, it was used primarily for research purposes. Today, it’s possible to order insulin levels quite easily. It costs less than $10 in my practice and in the hospital it’s accessible at the click of a button. Insulin levels are measured clinically on occasion, but it’s still not a common test.

There are two reasons it’s not commonly used to screen for diabetes. First, it’s just not standard practice. Most doctors follow the guidelines, and the guidelines don’t recommend using insulin levels. 

In fact, professional associations like the American Association for Clinical Chemistry and American Diabetes Association have explicitly recommended against using fasting insulin levels to screen for insulin resistance as recently as 2011.

Sacks et al. write:

> “It seems of greater clinical importance to quantify the consequences of the insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia (or hyperproinsulinemia) rather than the hormone values themselves, i.e., by measuring blood pressure, the degree of glucose tolerance, and plasma lipid/lipoprotein concentrations. It is these variables that are the focus of clinical interventions, not plasma insulin or proinsulin concentrations (366, 367 ).”

Disappointingly, Sacks et al., don’t acknowledge the idea that if you’re able to detect insulin resistance *before* it manifests as hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, you can alter the course of the disease so that those complications never occur. To give a concrete example, when I realized that I myself had early signs of insulin resistance, I made a swift course correction with my nutrition, exercise, body-composition, sleep, stress-management, and medications so as to avoid downstream consequences and complications.

The second reason that insulin levels aren’t frequently measured to detect insulin resistance is that they’re difficult to interpret. I order fasting insulin levels as part of my screening for insulin resistance, but there are no guidelines for interpreting fasting insulin levels. The threshold for the upper limit of normal on the Labcorp insulin test is 24.9 µIU/mL. But, this test is used for multiple purposes, not just for screening for insulin resistance. For example, this test might be ordered if one is looking for an insulin secreting tumor called an insulinoma. So, the lab’s normal range is not particularly helpful for diagnosing insulin resistance.

What complicates interpretation even further is the pathogenesis of type II diabetes. Early in the course of the disorder, most patients will have elevated insulin levels but normal fasting plasma glucose. Once a patient develops type II diabetes according to the diagnostic criteria, they may have elevated insulin levels and elevated glucose levels for some time if they remain untreated. In some individuals, after many years, the pancreas may become deficient in producing insulin due to glucolipotoxicity. Depending on the patient’s diet and body habitus, it’s plausible that such a patient, having been previously undiagnosed, could have normal fasting plasma glucose and normal fasting insulin    levels, simply because the pancreas cannot make enough insulin. Admittedly, I believe this would be a rare scenario, but it could happen. Additionally, some patients may produce insulin autoantibodies, which can complicate the measurement of insulin.

Even if you measure insulin at the right time in the right person and there are no complicating factors, distinguishing a normal level from an abnormal level is quite difficult.

In 1993, Laakso et al. published a paper titled “How good a marker is insulin level for insulin resistance?” In this paper, they tested 50 subjects with normal glucose tolerance, 28 with impaired glucose tolerance, and 54 with non-insulin dependent diabetes (aka type II diabetes). Within their study, 100% of participants who had normal glucose tolerance but a fasting insulin level > 18 µIU/mL were insulin resistant.
