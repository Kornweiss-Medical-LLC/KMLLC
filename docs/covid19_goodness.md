### An Awesome Article about Healthcare Deregulation

[The Objective Standard](https://www.theobjectivestandard.com/) published an awesome article titled ["Silver Linings in State Responses to COVID-19"](https://www.theobjectivestandard.com/2020/04/silver-linings-in-state-responses-to-covid-19/) by [Jared M. Rhoads](https://www.theobjectivestandard.com/author/jrhoads/)

**Here is an excerpt from the introduction:**

>"As Americans endure a pandemic of COVID-19, there is much to criticize regarding the public health orders that authorities at various levels have issued and the way in which they have issued them. However, a wave of deregulation temporarily is transforming some aspects of state health-care policy for the better. Calling attention to these actions can encourage other states to follow suit nowâ€”and increase the chance of achieving permanent deregulation later. Below are five broad areas in which state responses to the COVID-19 crisis have been promising. This is not a comprehensive list, but it illustrates this trend."
