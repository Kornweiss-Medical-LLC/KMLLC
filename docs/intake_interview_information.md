# Information about Intake Interview

**Call Description**

This is a 90 minute Zoom Call.

**Call Objective**

To assess your:
- past and current health
- health and performance goals
- ability and willingness to undergo testing and interventions

I’ll ask you about past and current medical problems, surgeries, hospitalizations, doctor visits, allergies, immunizations, medications, supplements, nutrition, exercise, sleep, and stress management. I’ll assess your appetite for potential testing and interventions in order to determine the appropriate intensity of your individualized health plan.

**Materials to Prepare**

You do not have to prepare any materials in advance, but if you send me any or all of the following prior to our meeting, it may save time and enrich the interview.
- Medical Records
- Lab results
- Nutrition, exercise, and sleep logs
- Biometrics (e.g. blood pressures, heart rates, heart-rate variability, height, weight body composition)
- Genetic tests
- Medication and supplementation lists
- Family medical history

**Family Medical History**

Collecting a detailed family history may be the most tedious task I assign you. However, I believe this is a valuable activity that may reveal unique long-term health risks that will inform your preventive care plan.

I have digital and paper forms that make this task more straightforward, but I'd like to discuss this with you before I ask you to spend time on it.

**Medical Record Collection**

I can perform this service in-house, but I prefer my clients to use a service called [Picnic Health](https://picnichealth.com/how-it-works). This is a digital service that collects, scans, encrypts, and digitizes all of your medical records. It requires little effort to set up an account. You’ll be able to share this with me easily and it’ll enable me to review your records in an efficient manner. This service is independent of my practice, so you’ll retain this useful resource in the future if you leave my practice or visit other physicians. You can click the link above to get started.

**Sharing Other Health Data**

Please feel free to send me invitations to view data on any of your health and fitness platforms. 

Examples:
- Apple Health
- Android Health
- Fitbit
- Garmin
- Whoop
- ŌURA
- Withings
