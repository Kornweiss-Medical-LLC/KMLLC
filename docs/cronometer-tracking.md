# Tracking and Analyzing Nutrition


It turns out that nutrition is pretty hard to track. Think back two days ago. What did you eat? How much carbohydrate, fat, and protein did you eat? How much zinc did you consume? We'll never know. This is why I track almost all of my nutrition, and I do the same with many of my clients for key periods of time. My preferred app is [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/). 

Read on to see how I use this awesome tool.

## Recording Food Items
Enter your food items in real time as you eat them throughout the day. This might seem cumbersome at first, but once you enter a couple items, it becomes second nature and goes quickly. Even for a complex meal, you'll spend 3-5 minutes entering data. If the meal is simple, or is a product or recipe that you've previously entered, it may take only seconds.

A Day's Worth of Entry

**Tips for accurate tracking:**

### Choose Generics Not Brands When Logging
Enter generic food items for the richest nutritional data. (e.g. choose "almonds" rather than "Trader Joe's almonds."

### Eat Whole Foods
As a corollary to #1, eat whole foods, as they're simpler to track, and in most cases, probably healthier in every way.

### Weight Your Food
Get a kitchen scale. When you eat at home, put your plate on the scale and add one item at a time, noting the weight in grams. Record each item and its weight in Cronometer.

### Learn From Experts
Check out [Chris Masterjohn's recommendations](https://chrismasterjohnphd.com/lite-videos/2018/07/24/track-vitamin-mineral-intake) on how to use Cronometer for tracking.

## Viewing Data
As you enter foods throughout the day, you'll receive feedback from these graphs. The bars fill up based on the daily requirements. The app comes preloaded with daily requirements based on [RDAs (recommended daily allowances)](https://ods.od.nih.gov/Health_Information/Dietary_Reference_Intakes.aspx) for adults. These targets can be customized. When you're using the app or the website, clicking or hovering over a particular macro or micronutrient display will reveal which foods contributed towards your intake of a particular nutrient and to what degree.

**Tips for meeting requirements:**

### Learn From Tracking
Pay attention to the nutrition information and target values as you enter items for the day. After a few days of doing this, you'll see which foods contain which nutrients and in what amounts. After a few weeks, you'll start to naturally remember this without much extra effort on your part. You'll be getting a nutrition education while you track.

### Use The Oracle Button
Use the Oracle button to receive suggestions for foods that could complete your remaining nutrition requirements for the day. Common deficiencies include Zinc, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Selenium, and Vitamin D to name a few. And thus, the Oracle will often suggest foods rich in these nutrients - fish, organ meats, and dark green leafy vegetables for instance.

### Trends Matter More than Single Days
Unless you are treating a specific deficiency or medical problem, you don't need to worry too much about missing a target here or there. There are depots for many nutrients in the body, so a healthy person won't become depleted in just a day or two. Instead, use the Trends --> Nutrition Report tab to look at averages for weeks or months to see if there is a pattern of a deficiency across longer periods of time.

### Use Recipes To Save Time
Create Custom Recipes to Save Time
Most people have some dietary staples that they eat repeatedly. If you don't, developing some staples is a great thing to do. By doing this, you remove a lot of the "activation energy," that's usually required to eat well consistently. A staple is a food that you know you like, that's easy to prepare, with known nutritional value. Once you settle on a staple, save it in Cronometer by using the "Custom Recipe" feature. This allows you to track accurately and quickly. You can see in the screenshot a custom recipe that I saved - quick oats, pecans, berries, chia seeds, and a hard-boiled egg.

**Tips for recipes / staples:**

### Simplicity is Key. 
The simpler your staple, the more likely it is that you can reliably have access to this food. It needs to be cheap, convenient, and easy to prepare. Making it easy to track by saving it in Cronometer is the final step.

### New Staples Can Replete Deficiencies
Fill in the gaps. Use specific staples/recipes to fill in specific gaps. If you know that your usual diet is extremely deficient in Omega-3 fatty acids, for instance, create a staple that you know will give you a periodic complement of omega-3 fatty acids - salmon, mackerel, herring, fish-oil supplement, pharma grade omega-3, etc.
