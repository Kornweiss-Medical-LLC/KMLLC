  abstract = {Background Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the commonest endocrine disturbance affecting women in the reproductive age group and encompasses signs of hyperandrogenism, menstrual cycle disturbances and obesity. Some of the symptoms of PCOS may be ameliorated by the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP). Methods A pilot observational study was carried out in a university teaching hospital setting to determine whether the clinical and biochemical features of PCOS are ameliorated by a new COCP, Yasmin\textregistered, which contains a new progestogen, drosperinone. Treatment with Yasmin was given for 6 months to 17 patients. Results Thirteen patients (76\%) completed 6 months of therapy. Good cycle control was achieved in all patients. Percentage body fat increased, with no overall change in body mass index. Fasting insulin and triglyceride concentrations rose significantly. Serum total testosterone concentrations fell with a concomitant rise in sex hormone binding globulin levels. Hirsutism scores did not change significantly in the 12 women who were clinically hirsute. There was, however, a significant improvement in the acne scores. Four of the 17 patients dropped out of the trial between Cycles 3 and 5 due to side effects. Conclusions Yasmin provides good cycle control for women with PCOS, with an improvement in acne over 6 months but not in other symptoms of the syndrome. Key message points  Yasmin provides control of the menstrual cycle in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).  Acne improves, and hirsutism and BMI do not change, in women prescribed Yasmin for PCOS.},

Many authors have pointed out that PSA screening is flawed because of its relatively poor sensitivity and specificity.2 One potential strategy to improve the sensitivity of PSA evaluations in the context of metastatic disease includes ``PSA velocity,'' or PSA doubling times.3 Since the Prostate Cancer Prevention . . .},

We have previously described that persons originating from the Indian subcontinent (Asian Indians) manifest excessive insulin resistance even in the absence of obesity. Therefore, in this study, we tested the hypothesis that nondiabetic, insulin-resistant Asian Indians differ from less insulin-resistant Caucasians of similar age and body composition in adipose tissue production of leptin and adiponectin, and in suppression of plasma NEFA concentrations during hyperinsulinemia. Seventy-nine Asian Indian men were compared with 61 Caucasian men. Higher plasma NEFAs and leptin in Asian Indians (P \&lt; 0.0001 and P = 0.003 for NEFAs and leptin, respectively) and lower plasma concentrations of adiponectin (P = 0.009) were not explained by body fat content and distribution. Oral glucose tolerance test studies revealed that Caucasian men had greater suppression of plasma NEFAs than Asian Indian men. We conclude that plasma concentrations of the adipose tissue metabolites leptin and NEFAs are higher and that of adiponectin is lower in insulin-resistant Asian Indians compared with more insulin-sensitive Caucasians. These differences may contribute to the excessive prevalence of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in nonobese Asian Indians.},

  abstract = {Studies were carried out on cholesterol metabolism in 11 nonobese patients and 16 obese patients with hypothyroidism and 13 with hyperthyroidism. The patients underwent several investigations under metabolic ward conditions. Hypothyroid patients usually had an increase in low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. Several mechanisms may have combined to cause a high LDL. For instance, the obese hypothyroid patients had an increase in cholesterol synthesis. Absorption of cholesterol also was increased frequently. However, other mechanisms not explored in this study probably contributed to most of the fall in LDL-cholesterol. Treatment of hypothyroid patients produced the expected fall in LDL. One possible mechanism could be that thyroid hormones enhance the conversion of cholesterol into bile acids; this mechanism has been suggested by other workers from animal studies. However, no evidence was obtained in either hypothyroid or hyperthyroid patients that thyroid hormones alter synthesis of bile acids. On the other hand, the hormones appeared to increase the synthesis of cholesterol. Patients with hypothyroidism frequently had supersaturated bile. The cause was mostly an enhanced secretion of biliary cholesterol associated with a tendency to obesity and increased synthesis of cholesterol. In contrast, the usually thin hyperthyroid patients did not have supersaturated bile. The studies show that thyroid hormones a) influence LDL-cholesterol by an action on the catabolism of LDL-independent of alterations in synthesis, catabolism, absorption, or excretion: b) stimulate synthesis of cholesterol; and c) affect biliary lipid metabolism in large part by influencing energy balance and cholesterol synthesis.},

  abstract = {Caffeine is a commonly used neurostimulant that also produces cerebral vasoconstriction by antagonizing adenosine receptors. Chronic caffeine use results in an adaptation of the vascular adenosine receptor system presumably to compensate for the vasoconstrictive effects of caffeine. We investigated the effects of caffeine on cerebral blood flow (CBF) in increasing levels of chronic caffeine use. Low (mean = 45 mg/day), moderate (mean = 405 mg/day), and high (mean = 950 mg/day) caffeine users underwent quantitative perfusion magnetic resonance imaging on four separate occasions: twice in a caffeine abstinent state (abstained state) and twice in a caffeinated state following their normal caffeine use (native state). In each state, there were two drug conditions: participants received either caffeine (250 mg) or placebo. Gray matter CBF was tested with repeated-measures analysis of variance using caffeine use as a between-subjects factor, and correlational analyses were conducted between CBF and caffeine use. Caffeine reduced CBF by an average of 27\% across both caffeine states. In the abstained placebo condition, moderate and high users had similarly greater CBF than low users; but in the native placebo condition, the high users had a trend towards less CBF than the low and moderate users. Our results suggest a limited ability of the cerebrovascular adenosine system to compensate for high amounts of daily caffeine use. Hum Brain Mapp 2009. \textcopyright{} 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Without effective treatments, outbreaks in such facilities will become commonplace and will result in severe morbidity and mortality. The effectiveness of doxycycline (DOXY) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) combination therapy in high risk COVID-19 patients in long-term care facilities is not yet understood. Objective: The goal of this analysis is to describe outcomes after use of DOXY-HCQ combination in high-risk COVID-19 patients in LTCF. Design: Case-series analysis. Setting: Three (3) LTCFs in New York. Participants: From March 19 to March 30, 2020, fifty-four (54) patients, residents of three (3) LTCFs in New York and diagnosed (confirmed or presumed) with COVID-19, were included in this analysis. Exposure: All patients who were diagnosed (confirmed or presumed) with COVID-19 received DOXY-HCQ combination therapy along with standard of care. Main Outcomes and Measures: Patients characteristics, clinical recovery, radiological improvements, medication side-effects, hospital transfer, and death were assessed as outcome measures. Results: A series of fifty-four (54) high-risk patients, who developed a sudden onset of fever, cough, and shortness of breath (SOB) and were diagnosed or presumed to have COVID-19, were started with a combination of DOXY-HCQ and 85\% (n=46) patients showed clinical recovery defined as: resolution of fever and SOB, or a return to baseline setting if patients are ventilator-dependent. A total of 11\% (n=6) patients were transferred to acute care hospitals due to clinical deterioration and 6\% (n=3) patients died in the facilities. Naive Indirect Comparison suggests these data were significantly better outcomes than the data reported in MMWR (reported on March 26, 2020) from a long-term care facility in King County, Washington where 57\% patients were hospitalized, and 22\% patients died. Conclusion: The clinical experience of this case series indicates DOXY-HCQ treatment in high-risk COVID-19 patients is associated with a reduction in clinical recovery, decreased transfer to hospital and decreased mortality were observed after treatment with DOXY-HCQ.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Purpose: To investigate the diagnostic value and consistency of chest CT as compared with comparison to RT-PCR assay in COVID-19. Methods: From January 6 to February 6, 2020, 1014 patients in Wuhan, China who underwent both chest CT and RT-PCR tests were included. With RT-PCR as reference standard, the performance of chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 was assessed. Besides, for patients with multiple RT-PCR assays, the dynamic conversion of RT-PCR results s (negative to positive, positive to negative, respectively) was analyzed as compared with serial chest CT scans for those with time-interval of 4 days or more. s Results: Of 1014 patients, 59\% (601/1014) had positive RT-PCR results, and 88\% (888/1014) had positive chest CT scans. The sensitivity of chest CT in suggesting COVID-19 was 97\% (95\%CI, 95-98\%, 580/601 patients) based on positive RT-PCR re results. In patients with negative RT-PCR results, 75\% (308/413) had positive chest CT findings; of 308, 48\% were considered as highly likely cases, with 33\% as probable cases. By analysis of serial RT-PCR assays and CT scans, the mean interval time between the initial negative to positive RT-PCR results was 5.1 {$\pm$} 1.5 days; the initial positive to subsequent negative RT-PCR result was 6.9 {$\pm$} 2.3 days). 60\% to 93\% of P cases had initial positive CT consistent with COVID-19 prior (or parallel) to the initial positive RT-PCR results. 42\% (24/57) cases showed improvement in follow-up chest CT scans before the RT-PCR results turning negative. Conclusion: Chest CT has a high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19. Chest CT may be considered as a primary tool for the current COVID-19 detection in epidemic Inareas.},

BACKGROUND: Niacin has been reported to lower apoB and Lp(a) and to raise apoA-1. METHODS: Individuals with CV disease and low baseline levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were randomized to simvastatin plus placebo or simvastatin, plus extended-release niacin ([ERN], 1,500 to 2,000 mg/day), with ezetimibe added as needed, in both groups, to maintain an on-treatment low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the range of 40 to 80 mg/dl. Hazard ratios (HRs) were used to evaluate the relationship between levels of apoA-1, apoB, and Lp(a), and CV events in each treatment group. RESULTS: Baseline apoB and the apoB/apoA-I ratio were significantly predictive of CV events only for the placebo group (HR: 1.17 [p = 0.018] and HR: 1.19 [p = 0.016]). Baseline and on-study Lp(a) were predictive of CV events in both simvastatin plus placebo (baseline HR: 1.24 [p = 0.002] and on-study HR: 1.21 [p = 0.017]) and the simvastatin plus ERN group (baseline HR: 1.25 [p = 0.001] and on-study HR: 1.18 [p = 0.028]). The ERN modestly increased 1-year apoA-1 (7\%), decreased apoB (13\%), decreased the ApoB/ApoA-1 ratio (19\%), and decreased Lp(a) 21\%, but did not reduce CV events. CONCLUSIONS: Lp(a) was associated with increased CV risk in both treatment groups indicating that it contributes to residual CV risk. However, there was no evidence that ERN reduced CV risk, despite favorable lipoprotein changes.},

Results Compared to placebo, active treatment with the combination pill did not decrease the risk of the primary combined endpoint (226.9 per 10,000 person-years versus 219.2 per 10,000 person-years; relative risk =1.03; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.90\textendash 1.19, P=0.65), or any of the secondary outcomes including MI (34.5 per 10,000 person-years versus 39.5 per 10,000 person-years; relative risk =0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.63\textendash 1.22), stroke (41.9 per 10,000 person-years versus 36.8 per 10,000 person-years in placebo; relative risk =1.14; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.82\textendash 1.57), and CVD mortality (50.3 per 10,000 person-years versus 49.6 per 10,000 person-years; relative risk =1.01; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.76\textendash 1.35). In a blood sub-study, geometric mean plasma homocysteine level was decreased by 18.5\% (95\% CI, 12.5\textendash 24.1; P{$<$}0.001) in the active arm (n=150) over that observed in the placebo arm (n=150) for a difference of 2.27 {$\mu$}mol per liter (95\% CI, 1.54 \textendash 2.96). CONCLUSION Over the longest follow-up recorded thus far, a combination of folic acid/vitamin B6/vitamin B12 did not reduce a combined endpoint of total cardiovascular events among high-risk women despite significant homocysteine lowering.

  abstract = {Spinal epidural abscess (SEA) is a rare but devastating condition. Entry of infectious contents into the epidural space occurs via contiguous infected tissue, hematogenous spread, or iatrogenic inoculation. Traditionally, emergency providers are taught to assess for the "classic triad" of spinal pain, fever, and neurological deficits, but this constellation of findings is seen in only 10-15\% of cases. Delays in diagnosis and treatment of this condition directly correspond to worse, and often debilitating, outcomes for these patients. This review will demonstrate the challenges of diagnosing SEA, describe key diagnostic pitfalls, and present a model and framework for its evaluation. The authors conducted a systematic review in PubMed and Google Scholar for articles describing the emergency medicine evaluation and management of spinal epidural abscess dating from 1996 to 2016. Of the initial 219 articles found, 18 articles were selected based on their relevancy to emergency medicine. Lower back pain is a common chief complaint, whereas SEA is a rare condition and may not be anticipated. The "classic triad" of SEA symptoms presents infrequently. Moreover, the early symptoms of back pain and fever are non-specific, and patients seek medical attention at varying stages of disease progression. Once the more conspicuous and wide-ranging neurological symptoms develop, they are often irreversible. In fact, final outcomes correlate with the severity and duration of symptoms before surgery. Furthermore, discovering these late neurological symptoms can be particularly difficult in bed-bound and chronically ill patients. MRI is the best diagnostic imaging tool for SEA. Early diagnosis is the major prognostic factor for favorable outcome of SEA, and yet, making this diagnosis in the emergency department (ED) has proved challenging. Shifting from a "classic triad" screening to a risk factor-based model of evaluation represents the current optimal strategy for diagnosing SEA. An algorithm incorporating the most recent data is provided.},

However, intranasal zinc has been reported as a cause of anosmia in humans and animals. Seventeen patients presenting with anosmia after the use of intranasal zinc gluconate are described. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective case series of patients presenting to a nasal dysfunction clinic and conducted complete history and physical examination on all patients, including nasal endoscopy. All patients underwent detailed odor threshold and identification testing. RESULTS: Threshold and identification testing revealed impaired olfaction in all patients. Inflammatory and traumatic causes of anosmia were excluded based on history, physical examination, and imaging. All patients diagnosed with zinc-induced anosmia or hyposmia reported sniffing deeply when applying the gel. This was followed by an immediate sensation of burning lasting minutes to hours. Loss of sense of smell was then perceived within 48 hours. Seven of 17 patients never developed symptoms of an upper respiratory infection. CONCLUSIONS: The zinc-induced anosmia syndrome, characterized by squirt, sniff, burn, and anosmia, occurs after the exposure of olfactory epithelium to zinc cation. It can be distinguished from postviral anosmia based on history.},

  abstract = {Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Due to its complexity in nature, effective breast cancer treatment can encounter many challenges. Traditional methods of cancer detection such as tissue biopsy are not comprehensive enough to capture the entire genomic landscape of breast tumors. However, with the introduction of novel techniques, the application of liquid biopsy has been enhanced, enabling the improvement of various aspects of breast cancer management including early diagnosis and screening, prediction of prognosis, early detection of relapse, serial sampling and efficient longitudinal monitoring of disease progress and response to treatment. Various components of tumor cells released into the blood circulation can be analyzed in liquid biopsy sampling, some of which include circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), cell-free RNA, tumor-educated platelets and exosomes. These components can be utilized for different purposes. As an example, ctDNA can be sequenced for genetic profiling of the tumors to enhance individualized treatment and longitudinal screening. CTC plasma count analysis or ctDNA detection after curative tumor resection surgery could facilitate early detection of minimal residual disease, aiding in the initiation of adjuvant therapy to prevent recurrence. Furthermore, CTC plasma count can be assessed to determine the stage and prognosis of breast cancer. In this review, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the various components of liquid biopsy used in breast cancer diagnosis and will expand on aspects that require further focus in future research.},

  abstract = {Autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (ADH) is a frequent (1/500) monogenic inherited disorder characterized by isolated elevation of LDL leading to premature cardiovascular disease. ADH is known to result from mutations at two main loci: LDLR (encoding the low density lipoprotein receptor), and APOB (encoding apolipoprotein B100), its natural ligand. We previously demonstrated that ADH is also caused by mutations of the PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) gene that encodes Narc-1 (neural apoptosis-regulated convertase 1). However, the role of this novel disease locus as a cause of hypercholesterolemia remains unclear. In the present study, we analysed the PCSK9 coding region and intronic junctions in 130 adult or pediatric patients with ADH, previously found as being non LDLR/non APOB mutation carriers. Four novel heterozygous missense variations were found: c.654A{$>$}T (p.R218S), c.1070G{$>$}A (p.R357H), c.1405C{$>$}T (p.R469W), and c.1327G{$>$}A (p.A443T). All mutations were absent in 340 normolipidemic controls. Except for the A443T, all mutations are nonconservative and modify a highly conserved residue. Segregation with hypercholesterolemia is incomplete in one pedigree. Type and severity of hyperlipidemia and of cardiovascular disease could vary among subjects from the same family. Finally, the proband carrying the R357H mutation exhibited very high plasma cholesterol during pregnancy, whereas the proband carrying the p.R469W mutation exhibited a severe phenotype of hypercholesterolemia in combination with a LDLR mutation resulting from a frameshift at residue F382 (1209delC). These observations suggest that variations in PCSK9 are a rare cause of non LDLR/non APOB ADH ({$\sim$} 2.3\%) and that additional environmental or genetic factors may contribute to the phenotype caused by PCSK9 missense mutations in humans. \textcopyright{} 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Single measures of blood pressure (BP) levels are associated with the development of atherosclerosis; however, long-term patterns in BP and their effect on cardiovascular disease risk are poorly characterized. OBJECTIVES: To identify common BP trajectories throughout early adulthood and to determine their association with presence of coronary artery calcification (CAC) during middle age. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort data from 4681 participants in the CARDIA study, who were black and white men and women aged 18 to 30 years at baseline in 1985-1986 at 4 urban US sites, collected through 25 years of follow-up (2010-2011). We examined systolic BP, diastolic BP, and mid-BP (calculated as [SBP+DBP]/2, an important marker of coronary heart disease risk among younger populations) at baseline and years 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 25. Latent mixture modeling was used to identify trajectories in systolic, diastolic, and mid-BP over time. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Coronary artery calcification greater than or equal to Agatston score of 100 Hounsfield units (HU) at year 25. RESULTS: We identified 5 distinct mid-BP trajectories: low-stable (21.8\%; 95\% CI, 19.9\%-23.7\%; n=987), moderate-stable (42.3\%; 40.3\%-44.3\%; n=2085), moderate-increasing (12.2\%; 10.4\%-14.0\%; n=489), elevated-stable (19.0\%; 17.1\%-20.0\%; n=903), and elevated-increasing (4.8\%; 4.0\%-5.5\%; n=217). Compared with the low-stable group, trajectories with elevated BP levels had greater odds of having a CAC score of 100 HU or greater. Adjusted odds ratios were 1.44 (95\% CI, 0.83-2.49) for moderate-stable, 1.86 (95\% CI, 0.91-3.82) for moderate-increasing, 2.28 (95\% CI, 1.24-4.18), for elevated-stable, and 3.70 (95\% CI, 1.66-8.20) for elevated-increasing groups. The adjusted prevalence of a CAC score of 100 HU or higher was 5.8\% in the low-stable group. These odds ratios represent an absolute increase of 2.7\%, 5\%, 6.3\%, and 12.9\% for the prevalence of a CAC score of 100 HU or higher for the moderate-stable, moderate-increasing, elevated-stable and elevated-increasing groups, respectively, compared with the low-stable group. Associations were not altered after adjustment for baseline and year 25 BP. Findings were similar for trajectories of isolated systolic BP trajectories but were attenuated for diastolic BP trajectories. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Blood pressure trajectories throughout young adulthood vary, and higher BP trajectories were associated with an increased risk of CAC in middle age. Long-term trajectories in BP may assist in more accurate identification of individuals with subclinical atherosclerosis.},

Using a longitudinal cohort study, we assessed the association between calcium intake, from both foods and supplements, and atherosclerosis, as measured by coronary artery calcification (CAC).Methods and ResultsWe studied 5448 adults free of clinically diagnosed CVD (52\% female; aged 45\textendash 84~years) from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Baseline total calcium intake was assessed from diet (using a food frequency questionnaire) and calcium supplements (by a medication inventory) and categorized into quintiles. Baseline CAC was measured by computed tomography, and CAC measurements were repeated in 2742 participants {$\approx$}10~years later. At baseline, mean calcium intakes across quintiles were 313.3, 540.3, 783.0, 1168.9, and 2157.4~mg/day. Women had higher calcium intakes than men. After adjustment for potential confounders, among 1567 participants without baseline CAC, the relative risk (RR) of developing incident CAC over 10~years, by quintile 1 to 5 of calcium intake, were 1 (reference), 0.95 (0.79\textendash 1.14), 1.02 (0.85\textendash 1.23), 0.86 (0.69\textendash 1.05), and 0.73 (0.57\textendash 0.93). After accounting for total calcium intake, calcium supplement use was associated with increased risk for incident CAC (RR=1.22 [1.07\textendash 1.39]). No relation was found between baseline calcium intake and 10-year changes in log-transformed CAC among those participants with baseline CAC {$>$}0.ConclusionsHigh total calcium intake was associated with a decreased risk of incident atherosclerosis over long-term follow-up,~particularly if achieved without supplement use. However, calcium supplement use may increase the risk for incident CAC.},

  abstract = {Hypercobalaminemia (high serum vitamin B12 levels) is a frequent and underestimated anomaly. Clinically, it can be paradoxically accompanied by signs of deficiency, reflecting a functional deficiency linked to qualitative abnormalities, which are related to defects in tissue uptake and action of vitamin B12. The aetiological profile of high serum cobalamin predominantly encompasses severe disease entities for which early diagnosis is critical for prognosis. These entities are essentially comprised of solid neoplasms, haematological malignancies and liver and kidney diseases. This review reflects the potential importance of the vitamin B12 assay as an early diagnostic marker of these diseases. A codified approach is needed to determine the potential indications of a search for high serum cobalamin and the practical clinical strategy to adopt upon discovery of elevated cobalamin levels. While low serum cobalamin levels do not necessarily imply deficiency, an abnormally high serum cobalamin level forms a warning sign requiring exclusion of a number of serious underlying pathologies. Functional cobalamin deficiency can thus occur at any serum level.},

Isolated quercetin is also marketed as a dietary supplement, mostly as the free quercetin aglycone, and frequently in daily doses of up to 1000 mg d\textendash 1 exceeding usual dietary intake levels. The present review is dedicated to safety aspects of isolated quercetin used as single compound in dietary supplements. Among the numerous published human intervention studies, adverse effects following supplemental quercetin intake have been rarely reported and any such effects were mild in nature. Published adequate scientific data for safety assessment in regard to the long-term use ({$>$}12 weeks) of high supplemental quercetin doses ({$\geq$}1000 mg) are currently not available. Based on animal studies involving oral quercetin application some possible critical safety aspects could be identified such as the potential of quercetin to enhance nephrotoxic effects in the predamaged kidney or to promote tumor development especially in estrogen-dependent cancer. Furthermore, animal and human studies with single time or short-term supplemental quercetin application revealed interactions between quercetin and certain drugs leading to altered drug bioavailability. Based on these results, some potential risk groups are discussed in the present review.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 4-year REDUCE study evaluated the efficacy and safety of 0.5 mg dutasteride daily for prostate cancer risk reduction in men with a prostate specific antigen of 2.5 to 10.0 ng/ml and a negative prostate biopsy. Specificity, sensitivity, and positive and negative predictive values of prostate specific antigen for the diagnosis of prostate cancer were assessed. RESULTS: Final prostate specific antigen before biopsy and change from month 6 to final prostate specific antigen performed better for the diagnosis of Gleason score 7-10 tumors in men who received dutasteride vs placebo as assessed by the area under the ROC curves (0.700 vs 0.650, p = 0.0491; and 0.699 vs 0.593, p = 0.0001, respectively). Increases in prostate specific antigen were associated with a higher likelihood of biopsy detectable, Gleason score 7-10 and clinically significant (modified Epstein criteria) prostate cancer. Percentage decreases in prostate specific antigen from baseline to month 6 in the dutasteride arm did not predict prostate cancer overall or Gleason score 7-10 cancer. CONCLUSIONS: In men with a previously negative prostate biopsy, prostate specific antigen performed better during the 4-year study as a marker of prostate cancer in men who received dutasteride vs placebo. The degree of prostate specific antigen increase after 6 months was a better indicator of clinically significant cancer in the dutasteride arm than in the placebo arm. Conversely, the initial decrease in prostate specific antigen in men taking dutasteride did not predict the likelihood of prostate cancer.},

Here, we determine whether the KL-VS allele influences cardiovascular disease risk factors, cardiovascular events, and ultimately, mortality. A total of 525 Ashkenazi Jews composed of 216 probands (age {$\geq$}95 years) and 309 unrelated individuals (ages 51 to 94) were genotyped for the KL-VS allele. In concordance with our previous data in Czech individuals (age {$\geq$}79; P{$<$}0.01), a heterozygous advantage for longevity was observed for individuals {$\geq$}79 years of age (P{$<$}0.004). Combined analysis indicates a 1.57-fold (95\% CI, 1.23 to 1.98) increased odds ratio (OR) for 5-year survival in two independent populations (P{$<$}0.0002). Cardiovascular disease risk factors were assessed through multivariate regression analysis, demonstrating that high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C; P{$<$}0.05) and systolic blood pressure (SBP; P{$<$}0.008) are associated with KL-VS genotype. History of vascular events was analyzed using logistic regression, indicating that after adjustment for traditional risk factors, heterozygous individuals were at significantly lower risk for stroke than wild-type individuals (OR, 5.88; 95\% CI, 1.18 to 29.41), whereas homozygous KL-VS individuals had the highest risk (OR, 30.65; 95\% CI, 2.55 to 368.00). Similarly, prospective analysis of mortality in probands using Cox regression indicates that wild-type individuals have a 2.15-fold (95\% CI, 1.18 to 3.91) and homozygous KL-VS individuals a 4.49-fold (95\% CI, 1.35 to 14.97) increase in relative risk for mortality after adjusting for potential confounders. Thus, cross-sectional and prospective studies confirm a genetic model in which the KL-VS allele confers a heterozygous advantage in conjunction with a marked homozygous disadvantage for HDL-C levels, SBP, stroke, and longevity.},

Participants: Consecutive patients hospitalized with a COVID-related admission in the health system from March 10, 2020 to May 2, 2020 were included. Only the first admission was included for patients with multiple admissions. All patients evaluated were 18 years of age and older and were treated as inpatients for at least 48 h unless expired within 24 h. Exposure: Receipt of hydroxychloroquine alone, hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin, azithromycin alone, or neither. Main outcome: The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Results: Of 2,541 patients, with a median total hospitalization time of 6 days (IQR: 4\textendash 10 days), median age was 64 years (IQR:53\textendash 76 years), 51\% male, 56\% African American, with median time to follow-up of 28.5 days (IQR:3\textendash 53). Overall in-hospital mortality was 18.1\% (95\% CI:16.6\%\textendash 19.7\%); by treatment: hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin, 157/783 (20.1\% [95\% CI: 17.3\%\textendash 23.0\%]), hydroxychloroquine alone, 162/1202 (13.5\% [95\% CI: 11.6\%\textendash 15.5\%]), azithromycin alone, 33/147 (22.4\% [95\% CI: 16.0\%\textendash 30.1\%]), and neither drug, 108/409 (26.4\% [95\% CI: 22.2\%\textendash 31.0\%]). Primary cause of mortality was respiratory failure (88\%); no patient had documented torsades de pointes. From Cox regression modeling, predictors of mortality were age{$>$}65 years (HR:2.6 [95\% CI:1.9\textendash 3.3]), white race (HR:1.7 [95\% CI:1.4\textendash 2.1]), CKD (HR:1.7 [95\%CI:1.4\textendash 2.1]), reduced O2 saturation level on admission (HR:1.5 [95\%CI:1.1\textendash 2.1]), and ventilator use during admission (HR: 2.2 [95\%CI:1.4\textendash 3.3]). Hydroxychloroquine provided a 66\% hazard ratio reduction, and hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin 71\% compared to neither treatment (p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusions and relevance: In this multi-hospital assessment, when controlling for COVID-19 risk factors, treatment with hydroxychloroquine alone and in combination with azithromycin was associated with reduction in COVID-19 associated mortality. Prospective trials are needed to examine this impact.},

Here, we utilized \emph{pcsk9}\textsuperscript{-/-} mice and an anti-PCSK9 antibody to study the role of the LDL receptor (LDLR) and ApoE in PCSK9-mediated regulation of plasma cholesterol and atherosclerotic lesion development. We found that circulating cholesterol and atherosclerotic lesions were minimally modified in \emph{pcsk9}\textsuperscript{-/-} mice on either an LDLR- or ApoE-deficient background. Acute administration of an anti-PCSK9 antibody did not reduce circulating cholesterol in an ApoE-deficient background, but did reduce circulating cholesterol (-45\%) and TGs (-36\%) in APOE*3Leiden.cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) mice, which contain mouse ApoE, human mutant APOE3*Leiden, and a functional LDLR. Chronic anti-PCSK9 antibody treatment in APOE*3Leiden.CETP mice resulted in a significant reduction in atherosclerotic lesion area (-91\%) and reduced lesion complexity. Taken together, these results indicate that both LDLR and ApoE are required for PCSK9 inhibitor-mediated reductions in atherosclerosis, as both are needed to increase hepatic LDLR expression.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Celiac disease (CeD) is a multifactorial disease influenced by both genetic and environmental risk factors. CeD genetic components are mainly due to HLA class II genes, which account for approximately 40\% of the disease heritability. The environmental factor is linked to gliadin ingestion. Despite genetic and epigenetic studies, the pathological molecular mechanism remains unclarified. The strong genetic component does not explain more than half of the hereditability; we identified several epigenetic features that contribute to the understanding of the missing hereditability. The lipid profile of infants has been proposed as a potential biomarker of CeD metabolism that can be measured before they exhibit developmental disorders and clinical symptoms. We suggest that the state of the host is a main factor for the abnormal immune response to gluten. Long before any exposure to the offending agent or any production of specific antibodies, several molecular mechanisms are differentially expressed in infants who will develop CeD compared to their peers matched for the same genetic profile. The present study explored the serum phospholipid profile of a group of infants at risk for celiac disease, followed up to 8 years to monitor the onset of CeD. We compared 30 patients who developed the disease with 20 age- and sex-matched peers with similar genetic profiles who did not develop the disease within 8 years. Serum phospholipids were analysed at 4 months, before exposure to gluten, and at 12 months of age, when none showed any marker of disease. In the 30 CeD patients, we also analysed the serum at the time of diagnosis ({$>$}24 months). The serum phospholipid profile was fairly constant across 4 and 12 months of age and, in CeD, up to 24\textendash 36 months. The phospholipid signature was dramatically different in infants who developed CeD when compared to that of control NY-CeD (Not Yet developing Celiac Disease) peers. We identified a specific serum phospholipid signature that predicts the onset of celiac disease in HLA at-risk infants years before the appearance of antibodies specific for CeD in the serum and before any clinical symptoms, even before gluten introduction into the diet at 4 months. Specifically, lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylcholine, alkylacyl-phosphatidylcholine, phosphoethanolamines, phosphatidylserines, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol were found to be differentially represented in CeD versus NY-CeD. A set constituted by a limited number of alkylacyl-phosphatidylcholine and lyso-phosphatidylcholine, together with the duration of breast-feeding, allows the discrimination of infants who develop celiac disease before 8 years of age from those at a similar genetic risk who do not develop the disease. In addition to recent discovery, our paper unveiled a specifc phopholipid profile, able to discriminate infants who eventually develop celiac disease years before antibodies or clinical symptoms ensue.},

It is inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder with homozygotes having a more severe phenotype than do heterozygotes. FH can result from mutations in the low density lipoprotein receptor gene (LDLR), the apolipoprotein B-100 gene (APOB), and the recently identified proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 gene (PCSK9). To date, over 700 variants have been identified in the LDLR gene. With the exception of a small number of founder populations where one or two mutations predominate, most geographically based surveys of FH subjects show a large number of mutations segregating in a given population. Studies of the prevalence of FH would be improved by the use of a consistent and uniformly applied clinical definition. Because FH responds well to drug treatment, early diagnosis to reduce atherosclerosis risk is beneficial. Cascade testing of FH family members is cost effective and merits further research. For screening to be successful, public health and general practitioners need to be aware of the signs and diagnosis of FH and the benefits of early treatment.},

Generally, it is recognized as a safe agent for ovulation induction, but rarely, it is associated with life-threatening conditions. A 36-year-old woman who had been prescribed clomiphene citrate for infertility was admitted to the emergency department for chest pain lasting for 2 hours. She had no history of smoking, and she did not have any cardiac risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI). An electrocardiogram performed on admission revealed ST-elevation in the precordial leads. She was taken to the catheter laboratory for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and the coronary angiography revealed total occlusion of the midportion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) with a heavy thrombus burden. The circumflex and right coronary arteries were normal. After balloon dilatation, a 2.75x15-mm drug eluting stent was implanted in the mid part of the LAD. The patient had an uncomplicated recovery. Before discharge, echocardiography revealed apical akinesis; anterior and lateral hypokinesis; and an ejection fraction of 45\% with mild mitral regurgitation. Although clomiphene citrate is a relatively safe drug for ovarian stimulation, it has been associated with serious side effects, such as MI. Physicians should be aware of the potential risks of clomiphene citrate, especially in patients with risk factors for coronary artery disease.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Statins are generally well tolerated, but some patients discontinue therapy secondary to adverse effects. Dosing a statin (rosuvastatin) every other ing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and reducing cardiovascular events. Overall, these agents have a remarkable safety profile, although some patients are intolerant of them. Common reasons for discontinuation of statin therapy include elevated hepatic enzyme levels, gastrointestinal complaints, and ``statin myopathy,'' which inday (EOD) may provide significant lipoprotein changes while avoiding common adverse effects in this statin-intolerant population. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect and tolerance of EOD rosuvastatin in patients previously intolerant to statin therapy. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients treated with EOD rosuvastatin at 2 lipid specialty clinics: the University of Kansas Lipid, Atherosclerosis, and LDL-Apheresis Center and the Hartford Hospital Cholesterol Management Center. Approximately 2600 charts were reviewed to identify patients receiving rosuvastatin EOD who previously had experienced statin intolerance. Fiftyone patients were eligible for the analysis, which evaluated changes in the lipid cludes myalgia, weakness, cramping, and rhabdomyolysis.1 Nonspecific muscle complaints or joint pain without elevated creatine kinase levels have been reported in approximately 5\% of clinical trial participants2; however, the range is wide (0.3\textendash 33\%).3 An observational study, the profile, the number achieving their low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals, and the percent tolerating rosuvastatin EOD. Laboratory data were assessed immediately prior to rosuvastatin EOD therapy and at the first follow-up. RESULTS: Myalgias (76.5\%) and increased transaminase levels (19.5\%) were the most common causes of prior statin intolerance, but 72.5\% (37/51) of patients were able to tolerate the EOD therapy (mean dose 5.6 mg) regimen for 4 {$\pm$} 2.9 (mean {$\pm$} SD) months. Mean LDL-C decreased 34.5\% (p {$<$} 0.001) in the patients who tolerated the regimen, enabling approximately 50\% to achieve their LDL-C PRIMO (Prediction of Muscular Risk in Observational conditions), reported muscle complaints in 10.5\% of the 7924 statin-treated subjects,4 suggesting that statin-induced myopathy is considerably more frequent in clinical practice. A number of other drugs (eg, bile acid resins, ezetimibe, niacin) are available to reduce LDL-C in patients who are statin goal. All patients who were considered to be intolerant to rosuvastatin EOD therapy (27.5\%; 14/51) reexperienced the symptoms of their prior statin intolerance. CONCLUSIONS: Treating patients intolerant to statins with rosuvastatin EOD was tolerated by the majority of patients and reduced LDL-C in our study. This dosing strategy may be useful in patients intolerant to once-daily statin dosing, although such an approach has not been documented to reduce cardiovascular events.},

It is a member of the tissue kallikrein family, some of the members of which are also prostate specific. PSA is a major protein in semen, where its function is to cleave semenogelins in the seminal coagulum. PSA is secreted into prostatic ducts as an inactive 244-amino acid proenzyme (proPSA) that is activated by cleavage of seven N-terminal amino acids. PSA that enters the circulation intact is rapidly bound by protease inhibitors, primarily alpha1-antichymotrypsin, although a fraction is inactivated in the lumen by proteolysis and circulates as free PSA. This proteolytic inactivation, as well as the cleavage of proPSA to PSA, is less efficient in PCa. Serum total PSA levels are increased in PCa, and PSA screening has dramatically altered PCa presentation and management. Unfortunately, although high PSA levels are predictive of advanced PCa, a large fraction of organ-confined cancers present with much lower total PSA values that overlap those levels found in men without PCa. Measurement of free versus total PSA can increase specificity for PCa, and tests under development to measure forms of proPSA may further enhance the ability to detect early-stage PCa. PSA is also widely used to monitor responses to therapy and is under investigation as a therapeutic target. Finally, recent data indicate that there may be additional roles for PSA in the pathogenesis of PCa.},

The range of triggering physical activities is broad, including as mild an effort as a stroll. EIA is not fully repeatable (ie, the same exercise may not always result in anaphylaxis in a given patient). In FDEIA, the combined ingestion of sensitizing food and exercise is necessary to precipitate symptoms. Clinical features and management do not differ significantly from other types of anaphylaxis. The pathophysiology of EIA and FDEIA is not fully understood. Different hypotheses concerning the possible influence of exercise on the development of anaphylactic symptoms are taken into consideration. These include increased gastrointestinal permeability, blood flow redistribution, and most likely increased osmolality.

Samples were also genotyped for the codon 405 isoleucine to valine (I405V) variation in the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene, which is involved in regulation of lipoprotein and its particle sizes.ResultsHigh-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle sizes were significantly higher in probands compared with both control groups (P = .001 for both), independent of plasma levels of HDL and LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1 and B. This phenotype was also typical of the proband's offspring but not of the age-matched controls. The HDL and LDL particle sizes were significantly larger in offspring and controls without hypertension or cardiovascular disease, (P = .001 and P = .008, respectively). Furthermore, lipoprotein particle sizes, but not plasma LDL levels, were significantly higher in offspring and controls without the metabolic syndrome (P\&lt;.001). Probands and offspring had a 2.9- and 3.6-fold (in men) and 2.7- and 1.5-fold (in women) increased frequency, respectively, of homozygosity for the 405 valine allele of CETP (VV genotype), respectively, compared with controls (P\&lt;.001 for both). Those probands with the VV genotype had increased lipoprotein sizes and lower serum CETP concentrations.ConclusionsIndividuals with exceptional longevity and their offspring have significantly larger HDL and LDL particle sizes. This phenotype is associated with a lower prevalence of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, the metabolic syndrome, and increased homozygosity for the I405V variant in CETP. These findings suggest that lipoprotein particle sizes are heritable and promote a healthy aging phenotype.},

  abstract = {Aging is characterized by a deterioration in the maintenance of homeostatic processes over time, leading to functional decline and increased risk for disease and death. The aging process is characterized metabolically by insulin resistance, changes in body composition, and physiological declines in growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and sex steroids. Some interventions designed to address features of aging, such as caloric restriction or visceral fat depletion, have succeeded in improving insulin action and life span in rodents. Meanwhile, pharmacologic interventions and hormonal perturbations have increased the life span of several mammalian species without necessarily addressing features of age-related metabolic decline. These interventions include inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin and lifetime deficiency in GH/IGF-1 signaling. However, strategies to treat aging in humans, such as hormone replacement, have mostly failed to achieve their desired response. We will briefly discuss recent advances in our understanding of the complex role of metabolic pathways in the aging process and highlight important paradoxes that have emerged from these discoveries. Although life span has been the major outcome of interest in the laboratory, a special focus is made in this study on healthspan, as improved quality of life is the goal when translated to humans.},

Methods We conducted a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database. Patients with PTC that had re-operation for disease from 2000\textendash 2016 were included. We defined recurrence as disease that developed after a patient had an undetectable thyroglobulin and negative ultrasound within one year of surgery. Results A total of 69 patients underwent 92 re-operations. On initial pathology: mean tumor size was 2.6cm; 50.7\% were multifocal; and 42\% had extra-thyroidal extension. Half (46\%) of the patients underwent a central/lateral neck dissection at initial surgery and 76.8\% were treated with post-operative radioactive iodine. The median time to first re-operation was 21 months (range, 1\textendash 292), and 41.8\% occurred within 1 year. Only three operations met criteria for true ``recurrence'', while 71 operations were categorized as persistence. Conclusion Many re-operations for PTC are for management of persistent disease. Over half of the patients required re-operation within the first two years, which strongly suggests that improvements in the pre-operative assessment and adequacy of initial surgery need to be made to improve the care of patients with thyroid cancer.},

  abstract = {3070             Background: A multi-cancer early detection (MCED) test that uses targeted methylation-based cfDNA technology to detect cancer and predict cancer signal origin (CSO) has potential to efficiently identify malignancies for which effective screening modalities do not exist. A previous version of a blood-based MCED test demonstrated favorable classification and test characteristics. Samples from the ongoing PATHFINDER study were reanalyzed in a prespecified interim analysis to evaluate performance of a more recent version of the test with an updated classifier (eg, updated CSO localization, hematological signal threshold) that is planned for clinical implementation as a general multi-cancer screening tool. Methods: PATHFINDER (NCT04241796) is an interventional, prospective study in which results (cancer signal detected/not detected and predicted CSO) using a previous version of the MCED test are returned to investigators, and those with a signal detected undergo further diagnostic testing. In this prespecified interim analysis, samples from those enrolled as of October 6, 2020 were reanalyzed with the more recent version of the MCED test (these results were not returned to investigators). The positive predictive value (PPV) for cancer detection, overall CSO accuracy, and concordance between the two test versions were assessed. Results: A total of 4011/4047 (99\%) participants (pts) were analyzable (mean [SD] age 63.9 [8.7] years, 62\% female, 92\% white, 24\% with prior cancer history, 39\% ever smoker [4\% current], 6\% with genetic cancer predisposition). Cancer signal was detected in 0.95\% (38/4011). A total of 27/38 also had signal detected by the previous version of the MCED test, including 19 who reached diagnostic resolution (13 with cancer diagnosis and 6 without); 11/38 were discordant positives. Nine different cancer types were detected in the 13 pts (2 stage I, 3 stage II, 2 stage III, and 3 stage IV); 1 had no AJCC stage expected, 1 metastatic recurrence and 1 stage evaluation underway. A conservative minimal PPV assuming all discordant positives are false positives, was 43.3\% (13/30, 95\% CI 27.4-60.8\%) based on 19 pts with diagnostic resolution and 11 discordant positives. High negative percent agreement (PA) 99.7\% (99.5-99.8\%) between the two test versions was observed. Positive PA of 43.5\% (95\% CI, 31.9-55.9\%) was consistent with the more stringent threshold for hematologic signal in the recent MCED version, as most discrepant cases had hematologic CSO with the previous MCED test. Among 13 detected cancers, accuracy of the top CSO prediction was 92.3\% (12/13, 95\% CI 66.7-99.6\%). Conclusions: In this prespecified interim analysis, the more recent version of the MCED test detected cancers with high PPV and high accuracy of CSO prediction, supporting readiness for use in clinical practice. Full enrollment cohort data will be available at the meeting. Clinical trial information: NCT04241796.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Studies in the 1970s and 1980s signaled concern that repeated influenza vaccination could affect vaccine protection. The antigenic distance hypothesis provided a theoretical framework to explain variability in repeat vaccination effects based on antigenic similarity between successive vaccine components and the epidemic strain.Areas covered: A meta-analysis of vaccine effectiveness studies from 2010\textendash 11 through 2014\textendash 15 shows substantial heterogeneity in repeat vaccination effects within and between seasons and subtypes. When negative effects were observed, they were most pronounced for H3N2, especially in 2014\textendash 15 when vaccine components were unchanged and antigenically distinct from the epidemic strain. Studies of repeated vaccination across multiple seasons suggest that vaccine effectiveness may be influenced by more than one prior season. In immunogenicity studies, repeated vaccination blunts the hemagglutinin antibody response, particularly for H3N2.Expert commentary: Substantial heterogeneity in repeated vaccination effects is not surprising given the variation in study populations and seasons, and the variable effects of antigenic distance and immunological landscape in different age groups and populations. Caution is required in the interpretation of pooled results across multiple seasons, since this can mask important variation in repeat vaccination effects between seasons. Multi-season clinical studies are needed to understand repeat vaccination effects and guide recommendations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In subjects with a high prevalence of metabolic risk abnormalities, the preferred replacement for saturated fat is unresolved. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to study whether carbohydrate or monounsaturated fat is a preferred replacement for saturated fat. DESIGN: Fifty-two men and 33 women, selected to have any combination of HDL cholesterol {$<$} or = 30th percentile, triacylglycerol {$>$} or = 70th percentile, or insulin {$>$} or = 70th percentile, were enrolled in a 3-period, 7-wk randomized crossover study. The subjects consumed an average American diet (AAD; 36\% of energy from fat) and 2 additional diets in which 7\% of energy from saturated fat was replaced with either carbohydrate (CHO diet) or monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA diet). RESULTS: Relative to the AAD, LDL cholesterol was lower with both the CHO (-7.0\%) and MUFA (-6.3\%) diets, whereas the difference in HDL cholesterol was smaller during the MUFA diet (-4.3\%) than during the CHO diet (-7.2\%). Plasma triacylglycerols tended to be lower with the MUFA diet, but were significantly higher with the CHO diet. Although dietary lipid responses varied on the basis of baseline lipid profiles, the response to diet did not differ between subjects with or without the metabolic syndrome or with or without insulin resistance. Postprandial triacylglycerol concentrations did not differ significantly between the diets. Lipoprotein(a) concentrations increased with both the CHO (20\%) and MUFA (11\%) diets relative to the AAD. CONCLUSIONS: In the study population, who were at increased risk of coronary artery disease, MUFA provided a greater reduction in risk as a replacement for saturated fat than did carbohydrate.},

  abstract = {Although the usual diet may contain 150-250 mg of plant sterols, chiefly beta-sitosterol, only trace amounts of these sterols have heretofore been found in human or animal blood and tissues. We now report elevated plant sterol levels in the blood and tissues of two sisters with extensive tendon xanthomas but normal plasma cholesterol levels. Besides beta-sitosterolemia and xanthomatosis, no other physical, mental, or biochemical abnormalities were detected.Repeatedly, the plasmas of the two sisters have contained 27.1 and 17.7 mg/100 ml of beta-sitosterol, 9.7 and 8.2 mg/100 ml of campesterol, and 0.5 and 0.5 mg/100 ml of stigmasterol, respectively. These plant sterols constituted 15.6 and 11.3\% of the total plasma sterols. Some 60\% of the plasma beta-sitosterol and campesterol was esterified; the measurable stigmasterol was entirely unesterified. The transport of the plasma beta-sitosterol and campesterol was largely in low density lipoproteins (76 and 83\%, respectively). High density lipoproteins carried the remainder. Plant sterols were barely detectable in the very low density lipoprotein fraction. Only trace amounts of stigmasterol could be detected in the low density and high density lipoprotein fractions. The plant sterol content of the red blood cells averaged 12-13 mg/100 ml packed cells or about 13\% of the total sterols. Two tendon xanthoma biopsies with the usual high concentration of cholesterol had 36.7 and 4.0 mg of plant sterols/g dry wt, of which 25.7 and 2.9 mg were beta-sitosterol, entirely in the free form. Plant sterols were also found in adipose tissue (0.2 mg/g wet wt) and in skin surface lipids (3.2 mg/g of lipid). The intestinal absorption of beta-sitosterol in both the patients, measured by two techniques, indicated greatly increased absorption of this sterol (about 24 and 28\% in the patients L. H. and R. H., respectively, normal absorption being {$<$}5\%). We suggest that increased absorption of beta-sitosterol must be considered as one cause of this disease. The reason for the extensive xanthomatosis in these two patients remains unknown. Perhaps in some way plant sterols initiated the development of xanthomas with otherwise normal plasma cholesterol levels. Clinical atherosclerosis has not yet occurred. The occurrence of beta-sitosterolemia in these two sisters with un-affected parents suggests an inherited recessive trait.},

No differences between groups could be observed at investigation of the low-frequency band (0.05\textendash 0.15 Hz), which was a surprising finding because this band represents also sympathetic cardiac innervation. At the high-frequency band (0.15\textendash 0.5 Hz), which represents parasympathetic cardiac innervation, an interaction of type and position influencing spectral power was detected. Our highly interesting findings indicate that primary focal hyperhidrosis is based on a much more complex autonomic dysfunction than generalised sympathetic overactivity and seems to involve the parasympathetic nervous system as well.},

Surgical treatment is effective, but irreversibleand complications may occur. Is it possible to develop an effective treatment procedure beside pharmaceuticals and surgery? Objective: To describe Osteopathic Manual Therapy (OMT) techniques and investigate the effect in patients suffering from GERD. Design: The study performed as an open, single-centre, one-armed interventional trial. Material: Eighteen female and four male GERD patients, mean age and disease duration of 47.4 years and 20.4 months, recruited from one single OMT practice. Method: The patients received three to 12OMT interventions consisting of thoracic spine and diaphragm mobilisation, traction of the cardia and posture correction. The interval between interventions was one week and the effect recorded as ``none,'' ``slight,'' ``moderate'' or ``good.'' The presence of heartburn, retrosternal pain, acid in the mouth, epigastric pain and tension or pain in the lower thoracic spine recorded before and three month after the last treatment. Results: The prevalence and total number of GERD symptoms were significantly reduced (p {$<<$} 0.01) and only two patients reported an unchanged situation. A ``moderate'' or ``good'' effect reported by 77.3 \% of the patients. In 19 patients with extended thoracic kyphosis and reduced extension, 78.9 \% reported a ``moderate'' or ``good'' treatment effect. No differences detected between patients using and not using additional GERD pharmaceuticals. Conclusions: The results indicate a positive effect of OMT in the treatment of GERD.},

Methods: In a multicenter, retrospective study, we studied a consecutive series of patients presenting with acute headache to 11 nonacademic hospitals. Inclusion criteria were (1) normal level of consciousness without focal deficits, (2) head CT {$<$}6 hours after headache onset and reported negative for the presence of SAH by a staff radiologist, and (3) subsequent CSF spectrophotometry. Two neuroradiologists and one stroke neurologist from 2 academic tertiary care centers independently reviewed admission CTs of patients with CSF results that were considered positive for presence of bilirubin according to local criteria. We investigated the negative predictive value for detection of SAH by staff radiologists in nonacademic hospitals on head CT in patients scanned {$<$}6 hours after onset of acute headache. Results: Of 760 included patients, CSF analysis was considered positive for bilirubin in 52 patients (7\%). Independent review of these patients' CTs identified one patient (1/52; 2\%) with a perimesencephalic nonaneurysmal SAH. Negative predictive value for detection of subarachnoid blood by staff radiologists working in a nonacademic hospital was 99.9\% (95\% confidence interval 99.3\%\textendash 100.0\%). Conclusions: Our results support a change of practice wherein a lumbar puncture can be withheld in patients with a head CT scan performed {$<$}6 hours after headache onset and reported negative for the presence of SAH by a staff radiologist in the described nonacademic setting.},

Aim To review the current knowledge on the underlying factors contributing to GERD, with particular emphasis on the most recent research. Methods Literature searches were conducted in Medline and EMBASE. The abstracts from recent large congresses were also reviewed to ensure coverage of the latest findings. Results The pathophysiological factors causing GERD can be split into those inducing greater exposure of the oesophagus to stomach contents, and those that provide increased perception of reflux or increased mucosal damage. Transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations, which are likely to be triggered by gastric distension, appear to be a key physiological cause of GERD. Excessive reflux may also be provoked by impaired oesophageal or gastric clearance mechanisms. Pre-epithelial, epithelial and post-epithelial defences all normally protect the oesophagus from injury, and may be compromised in individuals with GERD. Heartburn could also be caused by oesophageal hypersensitivity as a result of visceral neural pathway dysfunction. Conclusion The pathophysiology of GERD is multifactorial, and abnormalities in the gastro-oesophageal junction, the stomach, the oesophagus and the nervous system may all contribute to this disease state.},

Patients with elevated Lp(a) were randomized to antisense oligonucleotide [IONIS-APO(a)Rx] directed to apo(a) (n = 7) or placebo (n = 10). Ex vivo plasma lysis times and antigen concentrations of plasminogen, factor XI, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, and fibrinogen at baseline, day 85/92/99 (peak drug effect), and day 190 (3 months off drug) were measured. The mean {$\pm$} SD baseline Lp(a) levels were 477.3 {$\pm$} 55.9 nmol/l in IONIS-APO(a)Rx and 362.1 {$\pm$} 89.9 nmol/l in placebo. The mean{$\pm$} SD percentage change in Lp(a) for IONIS-APO(a)Rx was -69.3 {$\pm$} 12.2\% versus -5.4 {$\pm$} 6.9\% placebo (P {$<$} 0.0010) at day 85/92/99 and -15.6 {$\pm$} 8.9\% versus 3.2 {$\pm$} 12.2\% (P = 0.003) at day 190. Clot lysis times and coagulation/fibrinolysis-related biomarkers showed no significant differences between IONIS-APO(a)Rx and placebo at all time points. Clot lysis times were not affected by exogenously added Lp(a) at concentrations up to 200 nmol/l to plasma with very low (12.5 nmol/l) Lp(a) levels, whereas recombinant apo(a) had a potent antifibrinolytic effect. In conclusion, potent reductions of Lp(a) in patients with highly elevated Lp(a) levels do not affect ex vivo measures of fibrinolysis; the relevance of any putative antifibrinolytic effects of Lp(a) in vivo needs further study.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the FOURIER trial (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Patients With Elevated Risk), the PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor evolocumab reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and cardiovascular risk. It is not known whether the efficacy of evolocumab is modified by baseline inflammatory risk. We explored the efficacy of evolocumab stratified by baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). We also assessed the importance of inflammatory and residual cholesterol risk across the range of on-treatment LDL-C concentrations. METHODS: Patients (n=27\,564) with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and LDL-C {$\geq$}70 mg/dL on a statin were randomly assigned to evolocumab versus placebo and followed for a median of 2.2 years (1.8-2.5). The effects of evolocumab on the primary end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or coronary revascularization, and the key secondary end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke were compared across strata of baseline hsCRP ({$<$}1, 1-3, and {$>$}3 mg/dL). Outcomes were also assessed across values for baseline hsCRP and 1-month LDL-C in the entire trial population. Multivariable models adjusted for variables associated with hsCRP and 1-month LDL-C were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 7981 (29\%) patients had a baseline hsCRP{$<$}1 mg/L, 11\,177 (41\%) had a hsCRP 1 to 3 mg/L, and 8337 (30\%) had a hsCRP {$>$}3 mg/L. Median (interquartile range) baseline hsCRP was 1.8 (0.9-3.6) mg/L and levels were not altered by evolocumab (change at 48 weeks of -0.2 mg/dL [-1.0 to 0.4] in both treatment arms). In the placebo arm, patients in higher baseline hsCRP categories experienced significantly higher 3-year Kaplan-Meier rates of the primary and key secondary end points: 12.0\%, 13.7\%, and 18.1\% for the primary end point (Ptrend{$<$}0.0001) and 7.4\%, 9.1\%, and 13.2\% for the key secondary end point (Ptrend{$<$}0.0001) for categories of {$<$}1, 1 to 3, and {$>$}3 mg/dL, respectively. The relative risk reductions for the primary end point and key secondary end point with evolocumab were consistent across hsCRP strata (P-interactions{$>$}0.15 for both). In contrast, the absolute risk reductions with evolocumab tended to be greater in patients with higher hsCRP: 1.6\%, 1.8\%, and 2.6\% and 0.8\%, 2.0\%, and 3.0\%, respectively, for the primary and key secondary end points across hsCRP strata. In adjusted analyses of the association between LDL-C and hsCRP levels and cardiovascular risk, both LDL-C and hsCRP were independently associated with the primary outcome (P{$<$}0.0001 for each). CONCLUSIONS: LDL-C reduction with evolocumab reduces cardiovascular events across hsCRP strata with greater absolute risk reductions in patients with higher-baseline hsCRP. Event rates were lowest in patients with the lowest hsCRP and LDL-C. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT01764633.},

Hamstring and calf muscles were evaluated through the straight leg elevation test, popliteal angle test, and ankle dorsiflexion (knee extended and with the knee flexed). All variables were compared between the 2 groups. In addition, ROC curves, sensitivity, and specificity of the muscle contraction tests were also calculated to determine their potential predictive powers.Results:Differences between the 2 groups for the tests used to assess muscular shortening were significant (P {$<$} .001) in all cases. The straight leg elevation test and ankle dorsiflexion with the knee extended presented respective sensitivities of 94\% and 100\% and specificities of 82\% and 96\% as diagnostic tests for the participants in this study.Conclusion:Tightness of the posterior muscles of the lower limb was present in the plantar fasciitis patients, but not in the unaffected participants.Clinical Relevance:The results of this study suggest that therapists who are going to employ a stretching protocol for treatment of plantar fasciitis should look for both hamstring as well as triceps surae tightness. Stretching exercise programs could be recommended for treatment of plantar fasciitis, focusing on stretching the triceps surae and hamstrings, apart from an adequate tissue-specific plantar fascia-stretching protocol.Level of Evidence:Level III, case control study.},

OPTIONS: Measurement of plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) levels in the fasting state or 4-6 hours after oral methionine load; vitamin supplementation with folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12; adherence to the recommended daily allowance of dietary sources of folate and vitamins B6 and B12. OUTCOMES: This article reviews the available evidence on the association between plasma tHcy levels and CAD and the effect of lowering tHcy levels through vitamin supplementation or dietary intake. EVIDENCE: MEDLINE was searched for relevant English-language articles published from January 1966 to June 1999; also reviewed were additional articles identified from the bibliographies. BENEFITS, HARMS AND COSTS: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in Canada. Homocysteine, generated in the metabolism of methionine, may have a role in the development of cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in the general population is between 5\% and 10\% and may be as high as 30\%-40\% in the elderly population. If population-based studies are correct, tHcy may be responsible for up to 10\% of CAD events and thus may represent an important and potentially modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Laboratory testing for tHcy is currently restricted to research centres, and costs range from \$30 to \$50 per person. Newer, less costly techniques have been developed and should become readily available with time. VALUES: The strength of evidence was evaluated using the methods of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. RECOMMENDATIONS: Although there is insufficient evidence to recommend the screening or management of hyperhomocysteinemia at present (grade C recommendation), adherence to recommended daily allowance of dietary sources of folate and vitamins B12 and B6 should be encouraged. If elevated tHcy levels are discovered, vitamin deficiency should be ruled out to allow specific treatment and prevention of complications, such as neurological sequelae due to vitamin B12 deficiency. Experts in the field advocate treatment of elevated tHcy levels in high-risk people, such as those with a personal or family history of premature atherosclerosis or a predisposition to develop hyperhomocysteinemia. Definitive guidelines for the management of hyperhomocysteinemia await the completion of randomized trials to establish the effect of vitamin supplementation on CAD events.

The authors aimed to determine whether pharmacological reduction of systolic blood pressure (SBP) to a normal level ({$<$}120 mm Hg) would prevent cardiac morbidity and mortality in prehypertensive patients. In this secondary analysis, the authors obtained the data from SPRINT from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute data repository center. Among 9361 patients enrolled in SPRINT, 289 high-risk (ASCVD risk = 24.8\% {$\pm$} 13.0 [10-65]) prehypertensive patients without previous cardiovascular disease and not receiving any antihypertensive medications were enrolled. One hundred and forty-eight of them were assigned to standard treatment which consisted of clinical follow-up till SBP goes above 140 mm Hg and then staring medications to keep SBP {$<$}140 mm Hg. One hundred and forty-one were assigned to the intensive treatment receiving pharmacological SBP reduction to {$<$}120 mm Hg upon enrollment. The primary composite outcome was myocardial infarction, and other acute coronary syndromes, stroke, heart failure, or death from cardiovascular causes. Throughout the 3.06 years of follow-up, a primary outcome event was confirmed in three participants (0.74\% per year) in the intensive-treatment group and 8 (1.61\% per year) in the standard-treatment group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.19; P = .045). Rates of serious adverse events were not increased by intensive-treatment (HR, 0.83; P = .506). Based on this secondary post hoc analysis, intensive SBP reduction may probably be beneficial for primary prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in high-risk prehypertensive patients. This finding needs to be evaluated in a larger trial designed specifically to answer this question.},

This was an open-label study. Patients. Patients comprised a group of eight women with secondary amenorrhea. Interventions. An oral preparation containing CC (50 mg/day) was administered for 5 days followed by a double dose (100 mg/day) for another 5 days, initiated on day 3 after estrogen/progestogen-induced withdrawal bleeding. If ovulation and vaginal bleeding occurred, treatment continued in the two next months with 100 mg/day from day 3 to day 7 day of the cycle. Main outcome measures. Cycle control was evaluated at each visit, when patients recorded bleeding patterns and tablet intake. Data on the intensity and duration of bleeding were collected. Results. Six patients responded to the first cycle of CC administration, resuming normal menstrual cycles. The other two patients failed to menstruate after the first 10 days of treatment with CC and repeated the same protocol. After the second administration, these two women also had normal menstrual bleeding. Conclusions. The present data show that this new protocol of CC treatment may be useful to restore normal menstrual cycles in young women with hypothalamic amenorrhea.},

Our objectives were to characterize the Lp(a) proteome and to identify proteins that may be differentially associated with Lp(a) in patients with versus without CAVS. Our second objective was to identify genes that may be differentially regulated by exposure to high versus low Lp(a) levels in explanted aortic valves from patients with CAVS. We isolated Lp(a) from the blood of 21 patients with CAVS and 22 volunteers and performed untargeted label-free analysis of the Lp(a) proteome. We also investigated the transcriptomic signature of calcified aortic valves from patients who underwent aortic valve replacement with high versus low Lp(a) levels (n = 118). Proteins involved in the protein activation cascade, platelet degranulation, leukocyte migration, and response to wounding may be associated with Lp(a) depending on CAVS status. The transcriptomic analysis identified genes involved in cardiac aging, chondrocyte development, and inflammation as potentially influenced by Lp(a). Our multi-omic analyses identified biological pathways through which Lp(a) may cause CAVS, as well as key molecular events that could be triggered by Lp(a) in CAVS development.},

  abstract = {Various types of face masks available to the general public are worn for protection against inhalation of dust, pollutants, allergens, and pathogenic organisms. Recent news stories have illustrated the widespread use of face masks for protection against Swine flu (H1N1), Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (SARS), Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) virus outbreaks in Asia, and dust from the collapse of the World Trade Center. However, the level of protection provided by face masks is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine how efficiently face masks prevent respiratory exposure to potentially harmful aerosols. Three types of commonly available face masks were tested: a surgical mask, a pre-shaped dust mask, and a bandana. An N95 respirator was tested as the positive control. Masks were fit onto a Styrofoam? mannequin head modified with a 5/8-inch diameter sample probe that was placed inside a 147.5 liter test plenum; a 5/8-inch diameter reference probe was positioned next to the mannequin head. Saline aerosols were generated in the test plenum using an IV HEART? (Westmed, Inc., Tucson, AZ) nebulizer. Each face mask was challenged for 30 minutes. Filter samples were collected simultaneously from the mannequin and reference sample probes and used to calculate aerosol concentrations. The mannequin sample probe and the reference sample probe volumetric flow rates were 8.75 L/min and 1.72 L/min, respectively. The mean challenge aerosol concentration, determined from the reference sample probe, was 0.045 {$\pm$} 0.008 mg/L with a mass median aerodynamic particle size of 1.6 ?m. Face mask protective efficiency was calculated as the ratio of mannequin sample probe concentration to reference sample probe concentration. The protective efficiencies were 33.3\%, 11.3\%, and 6.1\% for the surgical, bandana, and dust masks, respectively. The N95 mask protective efficiency was 89.6\%. In conclusion, the surgical mask protected the best of the three face masks tested. However, it is important to note that all three masks offer very little protection when compared to the N95, and wearing these face masks may produce a false sense of protection.},

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, myocarditis/pericarditis rates are {$\approx$}12.6 cases per million doses of second-dose mRNA vaccine among individuals 12 to 39 years of age. In reported cases, patients with myocarditis invariably presented with chest pain, usually 2 to 3 days after a second dose of mRNA vaccination, and had elevated cardiac troponin levels. ECG was abnormal with ST elevations in most, and cardiac MRI was suggestive of myocarditis in all tested patients. There was no evidence of acute COVID-19 or other viral infections. In 1 case, a cardiomyopathy gene panel was negative, but autoantibody levels against certain self-antigens and frequency of natural killer cells were increased. Although the mechanisms for development of myocarditis are not clear, molecular mimicry between the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and self-antigens, trigger of preexisting dysregulated immune pathways in certain individuals, immune response to mRNA, and activation of immunologic pathways, and dysregulated cytokine expression have been proposed. The reasons for male predominance in myocarditis cases are unknown, but possible explanations relate to sex hormone differences in immune response and myocarditis, and also underdiagnosis of cardiac disease in women. Almost all patients had resolution of symptoms and signs and improvement in diagnostic markers and imaging with or without treatment. Despite rare cases of myocarditis, the benefit-risk assessment for COVID-19 vaccination shows a favorable balance for all age and sex groups; therefore, COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for everyone {$\geq$}12 years of age.},

Metformin mildly inhibits complex I of the electron transport system and may impact aerobic capacity in people exercising while taking metformin. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effects of metformin on maximal aerobic capacity in healthy individuals without mitochondrial dysfunction. Seventeen healthy, normal-weight men (n=11) and women (n=6) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Peak aerobic capacity was measured twice using a continuous, incrementally graded protocol; once after 7-9 d of metformin (final dose=2000 mg/d) and once with placebo, with 1 week between tests. The order of the conditions was counterbalanced. Peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak), heart rate (HR), ventilation (VE), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and test duration were compared across conditions using paired t tests with the R statistical program. VO2 peak (-2.7\%), peak heart rate (-2.0\%), peak ventilation (-6.2\%), peak RER (-3.0\%), and exercise duration (-4.1\%) were all reduced slightly, but significantly, with metformin (all p{$<$}0.05). There was no effect of metformin on RPE or ventilatory breakpoint. Correlations between the decrement in VO2 peak and any of the other outcome variables were weak (r2{$<$}0.20) and not significant. Short-term treatment with metformin has statistically significant, but physiologically subtle, effects that reduce key outcomes related to maximal exercise capacity. Whether this small but consistent effect is manifested in people with insulin resistance or diabetes who already have some degree of mitochondrial dysfunction remains to be determined.},

  abstract = {Background Oncology applications of cell-free DNA analysis are often limited by the amount of circulating tumor DNA and the fraction of cell-free DNA derived from tumor cells in a blood sample. This circulating tumor fraction varies widely between individuals and cancer types. Clinical factors that influence tumor fraction have not been completely elucidated. Methods and findings Circulating tumor fraction was determined for breast, lung, and colorectal cancer participant samples in the first substudy of the Circulating Cell-free Genome Atlas study (CCGA; NCT02889978; multi-cancer early detection test development) and was related to tumor and patient characteristics. Linear models were created to determine the influence of tumor size combined with mitotic or metabolic activity (as tumor mitotic volume or excessive lesion glycolysis, respectively), histologic type, histologic grade, and lymph node status on tumor fraction. For breast and lung cancer, tumor mitotic volume and excessive lesion glycolysis (primary lesion volume scaled by percentage positive for Ki-67 or PET standardized uptake value minus 1.0, respectively) were the only statistically significant covariates. For colorectal cancer, the surface area of tumors invading beyond the subserosa was the only significant covariate. The models were validated with cases from the second CCGA substudy and show that these clinical correlates of circulating tumor fraction can predict and explain the performance of a multi-cancer early detection test. Conclusions Prognostic clinical variables, including mitotic or metabolic activity and depth of invasion, were identified as correlates of circulating tumor DNA by linear models that relate clinical covariates to tumor fraction. The identified correlates indicate that faster growing tumors have higher tumor fractions. Early cancer detection from assays that analyze cell-free DNA is determined by circulating tumor fraction. Results support that early detection is particularly sensitive for faster growing, aggressive tumors with high mortality, many of which have no available screening today.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to analyze the disease-free intervals and calculate the freedom from atherosclerosis events in the Program on the Surgical Control of the Hyperlipidemias (POSCH). BACKGROUND: The POSCH study was a randomized, secondary lipid/atherosclerosis intervention trial that provided strong evidence for reduction in atherosclerosis progression as demonstrated by clinical and arteriographic end points. The 417 control group patients received American Heart Association phase II diet instruction, and the 421 intervention group patients received identical dietary instruction and underwent a partial ileal bypass operation. METHODS: Four outcome measures were determined: 1) overall mortality, 2) coronary heart disease mortality, 3) coronary heart disease mortality and confirmed nonfatal myocardial infarction, and 4) coronary/cardiac interventions. RESULTS: An overall mortality rate of 10\% occurred at 6.7 years in the control group and 9.4 years in the intervention group, for a gain in disease-free interval of 2.7 years in the intervention group (p = 0.032). A coronary heart disease mortality rate of 8\% occurred at 7.2 years in the control group and 11 years in the intervention group, for a gain of 3.8 years (p = 0.046). Twenty percent of patients demonstrated the combined end point of coronary heart disease mortality and confirmed nonfatal myocardial infarction at 5.9 years in the control group and 11.4 years in the intervention group, for a gain of 5.5 years (p {$<$} 0.001). Twenty-five percent of patients underwent either coronary artery bypass graft surgery, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or heart transplantation at 5.4 years in the control group and 12.4 years in the intervention group, for a gain of 7 years (p {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The marked lipid modification achieved by partial ileal bypass in the POSCH trial led to demonstrable increases in the disease-free intervals for overall mortality, coronary heart disease mortality, coronary heart disease mortality and confirmed nonfatal myocardial infarction, and coronary intervention procedures. For the clinician and the patient, estimation of disease-free intervals may be more relevant than assessment of differences in incidence rates and risk ratios.},

Preoperative total plasma cholesterol (TC) was 363.3 +/- 136.8 mg/dL (mean +/- SD) in these patients. Baseline and follow-up TC results demonstrated highly significant (p less than or equal to 0.001) TC reduction, 34\% (n = 48), 28\% (n = 49), 35\% (n = 26), 35\% (n = 11), and 30\% (n = 25) at 1, 2 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15, and more than 20 years, respectively, after PIB. In 21 patients with baseline, 1-year, and more than 20-year results TC decreased 33\% by 1 year and remained 29\% less than baseline more than 20 years after surgery (p = NS versus 1 year). Plasma triglyceride results were available in fewer patients, and no statistically significant changes developed after PIB. Two patients (3.5\%) underwent PIB reversal, one for intractable diarrhea and one for recurrent nephrolithiasis. In the 25 nonreversed, long-term survivors, no statistically significant weight change was noted. Twenty-four per cent had 0 to 2, 52\% had 3 to 5, and 24\% had more than 5 bowel movements per day. Subsequent cholecystectomy was required in eight patients, and nephrolithiasis developed in 10 (40\%). During 20 to 26 years, most survivors developed clinically apparent atherosclerosis: angina (60\%), myocardial infarction (16\%), or coronary artery bypass (28\%). Coronary heart disease was the predominant cause of death among nonsurvivors (80\%). Overall survival rates were 95\% 88\%, 75\%, 59\%, 53\%, and 41\% at 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 years, respectively, after PIB. Partial ileal bypass leads to highly significant TC reduction, which is sustained, essentially unchanged, more than 20 years after operation. In comparison to available epidemiologic and clinical trial data, these results support the hypothesis that TC reduction has a beneficial effect in patients with hypercholesterolemia.},

  abstract = {The first partial ileal bypass operation specifically for the reduction of plasma lipids was performed by us in 1963. Since then we have operated upon and followed for more than three months 126 hyperlipidemic patients. Clinical metabolic studies, before and after the procedure, have demonstrated a 60\% decrease in cholesterol absorption, a 3.8-fold increase in total fecal steroid excretion, a 5.7-fold increase in cholesterol synthesis, a 3-fold increase in cholesterol turnover, and a one-third decrease in the miscible cholesterol pool. Circulating cholesterol levels have been lowered an average 41.1\% from the preoperative but postdietary baseline. An average 53\% cholesterol reduction has been achieved from a pretreatment baseline using a combination of dietary and surgical management. Plasma triglycerides have been reduced in primary hypertriglyceridemic patients (type IV) an average of 52.6\% from their preoperative but postdietary baseline. One patient died in the hospital and there have been 13 late deaths over the past 10 years. Four cases of postoperative bowel obstruction required reoperation. Diarrhea following partial ileal bypass is, as a rule, transistory and not a significant problem. No appreciable weight loss results from partial ileal bypass, which is an obvious distinction from the results of the far more massive jejuno-ileal bypass procedure for obesity. We have not encountered hepatotoxic, lithogenic, or nephrolithiasis complications in our partial ileal bypass patients. Sixty-nine per cent of our patients with preoperative angina pectoris have postoperative improvement or total remission of this symptom complex. Serial appraisal of followup coronary arteriographic studies offers preliminary evidence for lesion regression. It is concluded that partial ileal bypass is the most effective means for lipid reduction available today; it is obligatory in its actions, safe, and associated with minimal side effects.},

  abstract = {While coronary artery calcium (CAC) has been extensively validated for predicting clinical events, most outcome studies of CAC have evaluated coronary heart disease (CHD) rather than atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events (including stroke). Also, virtually all CAC studies are of short- or intermediate-term follow-up, so studies across multi-ethnic cohorts with long-term follow-up are warranted prior to widespread clinical use. We sought to evaluate the contribution of CAC using the population-based MESA cohort with over 10\,years of follow-up for ASCVD events, and whether the association of CAC with events varied by sex, race/ethnicity, or age category.We utilized MESA, a prospective multi-ethnic cohort study of 6814 participants (51\% women), aged 45\textendash 84\,years, free of clinical CVD at baseline. We evaluated the relationship between CAC and incident ASCVD using Cox regression models adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, sex, education, income, cigarette smoking status, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, diabetes, lipid-lowering medication, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medication, intentional physical exercise, and body mass index. Only the first event for each individual was used in the analysis. Overall, 500 incident ASCVD (7.4\%) events were observed in the total study population over a median of 11.1\,years. Hard ASCVD included 217 myocardial infarction, 188 strokes (not transient ischaemic attack), 13 resuscitated cardiac arrest, and 82 CHD deaths. Event rates in those with CAC\,=\,0 Agatston units ranged from 1.3\% to 5.6\%, while for those with CAC\,\&gt;\,300, the 10-year event rates ranged from 13.1\% to 25.6\% across different age, gender, and racial subgroups. At 10\,years of follow-up, all participants with CAC\,\&gt;\,100 were estimated to have \&gt;7.5\% risk regardless of demographic subset. Ten-year ASCVD event rates increased steadily across CAC categories regardless of age, sex, or race/ethnicity. For each doubling of CAC, we estimated a 14\% relative increment in ASCVD risk, holding all other risk factors constant. This association was not significantly modified by age, sex, race/ethnicity, or baseline lipid-lowering use.Coronary artery calcium is associated strongly and in a graded fashion with 10-year risk of incident ASCVD as it is for CHD, independent of standard risk factors, and similarly by age, gender, and ethnicity. While 10-year event rates in those with CAC\,=\,0 were almost exclusively below 5\%, those with CAC\,{$\geq$}\,100 were consistently above 7.5\%, making these potentially valuable cutpoints for the consideration of preventive therapies. Coronary artery calcium strongly predicts risk with the same magnitude of effect in all races, age groups, and both sexes, which makes it among the most useful markers for predicting ASCVD risk.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Functional hypothalamic amenorrhoea (FHA) is a condition characterised by the absence of menses due to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to estimate uterine and ovarian sizes in adolescents with FHA and to compare these results with findings in peers having regular menstrual cycles. DESIGN: Prospective case-controlled study. SETTINGS: Vilnius University Hospital Santariskiu Klinikos, Lithuania. PATIENTS: Lithuanian adolescents--45 with FHA and 40 comparison group participants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We assessed ultrasound measurements of internal reproductive organs, levels of luteinising hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, oestradiol and calculated body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 16.3 {$\pm$} 1.2 years, the mean age after menarche--3.6 years. In adolescents with FHA the BMI was 17.8 {$\pm$} 1.8 kg/m(2) and 20.4 {$\pm$} 1.4 kg/m(2) in the comparison group, p {$<$} 0.001. The uterine volume (14.7 {$\pm$} 6.3 cm(3) vs 31.7 {$\pm$} 10.6 cm(3), p {$<$} 0.001), cervical length (2.3 {$\pm$} 0.4 cm vs 2.6 {$\pm$} 0.5 cm, p = 0.03), volume of both ovaries (9.3 {$\pm$} 3.6 cm(3) vs 13.8 {$\pm$} 4.3 cm(3), p {$<$} 0.001) and levels of LH (2.70 {$\pm$} 2.59 vs 6.01 {$\pm$} 2.44, p {$<$} 0.001) were significantly lower in girls with FHA. A significantly positive correlation between volume of uterus and levels of LH (r = 0.415; p {$<$} 0.001) was found. We identified a positive correlation between uterine volume, uterine corpus length, cervical length, ovarian volume and weight, BMI. CONCLUSIONS: In adolescents with FHA the dimensions of uterus and ovaries were smaller than in girls having regular menstrual cycles. Our study confirmed the influence of oestrogen on uterus size: oestrogen deficiency causes a reduction in uterine size. Uterine size and ovarian size correlate positively with BMI.},

  abstract = {Enveloped viruses need to fuse with a host cell membrane in order to deliver their genome into the host cell. While some viruses fuse with the plasma membrane, many viruses are endocytosed prior to fusion. Specific cues in the endosomal microenvironment induce conformational changes in the viral fusion proteins leading to viral and host membrane fusion. In the present study we investigated the entry of coronaviruses (CoVs). Using siRNA gene silencing, we found that proteins known to be important for late endosomal maturation and endosome-lysosome fusion profoundly promote infection of cells with mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV). Using recombinant MHVs expressing reporter genes as well as a novel, replication-independent fusion assay we confirmed the importance of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and demonstrated that trafficking of MHV to lysosomes is required for fusion and productive entry to occur. Nevertheless, MHV was shown to be less sensitive to perturbation of endosomal pH than vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza A virus, which fuse in early and late endosomes, respectively. Our results indicate that entry of MHV depends on proteolytic processing of its fusion protein S by lysosomal proteases. Fusion of MHV was severely inhibited by a pan-lysosomal protease inhibitor, while trafficking of MHV to lysosomes and processing by lysosomal proteases was no longer required when a furin cleavage site was introduced in the S protein immediately upstream of the fusion peptide. Also entry of feline CoV was shown to depend on trafficking to lysosomes and processing by lysosomal proteases. In contrast, MERS-CoV, which contains a minimal furin cleavage site just upstream of the fusion peptide, was negatively affected by inhibition of furin, but not of lysosomal proteases. We conclude that a proteolytic cleavage site in the CoV S protein directly upstream of the fusion peptide is an essential determinant of the intracellular site of fusion.},

We particularly focus on the biological aspects of those gene mutations and variants that impact on sterol absorption and hepatobiliary excretion via specific membrane transporter systems (NPC1L1, ABCG5/8); the incorporation of dietary sterols (MTP) and of de novo synthesized lipids (HMGCR, TRIB1) into apoB-containing lipoproteins (APOB) and their release into the circulation (ANGPTL3, SARA2, SORT1); and receptor-mediated uptake of LDL and of intestinal and hepatic-derived lipoprotein remnants (LDLR, APOB, APOE, LDLRAP1, PCSK9, IDOL). The insights gained from integrating the wealth of genetic data with biological processes have important implications for the classification of clinical and presymptomatic diagnoses of traditional LDL dyslipidemias, sitosterolemia, and newly emerging phenotypes, as well as their management through both nutritional and pharmaceutical means.},

Recent preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that chronic hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor for hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. It is probably also an independent risk factor for chronic kidney disease, Type 2 diabetes, and cognitive decline. These relationships have been observed for high serum UA levels ({$>$}5.5 mg/dL in women and {$>$}6 mg/dL in men), but also for normal to high serum UA levels (5\textendash 6 mg/dL). In this regard, blood UA levels are much higher in industrialized countries than in the rest of the world. Xanthine-oxidase inhibitors can reduce UA and seem to minimize its negative effects on vascular health. Other dietary and pathophysiological factors are also related to UA production. However, the role of fructose-derived UA in the pathogenesis of cardiometabolic disorders has not yet been fully clarified. Here, we critically review recent research on the biochemistry of UA production, the relationship between fructose intake and UA production, and how this relationship is linked to cardiometabolic disorders.},

Not only the bacteria on the epidermis, but also and especially those living in the sweat glands, sweat pores and hair follicles play a pivotal role in malodour development. To treat underarm malodour, this viewpoint article envisions a bacterial treatment. Replacing the autochthonous malodour-causing microbiome with a non-odour-causing microbiome, through an armpit bacterial transplantation or direct application of probiotics/non-odour-causing bacteria, could resolve the condition. Selective steering of the microbiome with prebiotics, biochemicals or plant extracts can likewise greatly help in improving the underarm odour. Elimination/inhibition of the ``bad bugs'' and application/stimulation of the ``good bugs'' will be part of the future treatment for axillary body odour.},

  abstract = {Diabetes and obesity are two metabolic diseases characterized by insulin resistance and a low-grade inflammation. Seeking an inflammatory factor causative of the onset of insulin resistance, obesity, and diabetes, we have identified bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a triggering factor. We found that normal endotoxemia increased or decreased during the fed or fasted state, respectively, on a nutritional basis and that a 4-week high-fat diet chronically increased plasma LPS concentration two to three times, a threshold that we have defined as metabolic endotoxemia. Importantly, a high-fat diet increased the proportion of an LPS-containing microbiota in the gut. When metabolic endotoxemia was induced for 4 weeks in mice through continuous subcutaneous infusion of LPS, fasted glycemia and insulinemia and whole-body, liver, and adipose tissue weight gain were increased to a similar extent as in high-fat-fed mice. In addition, adipose tissue F4/80-positive cells and markers of inflammation, and liver triglyceride content, were increased. Furthermore, liver, but not whole-body, insulin resistance was detected in LPS-infused mice. CD14 mutant mice resisted most of the LPS and high-fat diet-induced features of metabolic diseases. This new finding demonstrates that metabolic endotoxemia dysregulates the inflammatory tone and triggers body weight gain and diabetes. We conclude that the LPS/CD14 system sets the tone of insulin sensitivity and the onset of diabetes and obesity. Lowering plasma LPS concentration could be a potent strategy for the control of metabolic diseases.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Anaphylaxis is the most severe and frightening of the allergic reactions, placing patients at high risk and demanding prompt recognition and immediate management by health care providers. Yet because its symptoms imitate those of other diseases, such as asthma and urticaria, current data suggest that its diagnosis is often missed, with underuse of tryptase measurement; its treatment is delayed, with little use of epinephrine; and its underlying cause or causes are poorly investigated. Deaths from anaphylaxis are difficult to investigate because of miscoding. Surprisingly, patients treated with new and powerful chemotherapy agents and humanized mAbs present with nonclassical symptoms of anaphylaxis, and patients may present with unrecognized clonal mast cell disorders with \emph{KIT} mutations may present as Hymenoptera-induced or idiopathic anaphylaxis. The goal of this review is to recognize the presentations of anaphylaxis with the description of its current phenotypes, to provide new insight and understanding of its mechanisms and causes through its endotypes, and to address its biomarkers for broad clinical use. Ultimately, the aim is to empower allergists and heath care providers with new tools that can help alleviate patients' symptoms, preventing and protecting them against anaphylaxis.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Calcifediol can rapidly increase serum 25OHD concentration. We therefore evaluated the effect of calcifediol treatment, on Intensive Care Unit Admission and Mortality rate among Spanish patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Design parallel pilot randomized open label, double-masked clinical trial. Setting university hospital setting (Reina Sofia University Hospital, C\'ordoba Spain.) Participants 76 consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection, clinical picture of acute respiratory infection, confirmed by a radiographic pattern of viral pneumonia and by a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR with CURB65 severity scale (recommending hospital admission in case of total score {$>$} 1). Procedures All hospitalized patients received as best available therapy the same standard care, (per hospital protocol), of a combination of hydroxychloroquine (400\,mg every 12\,hours on the first day, and 200\,mg every 12\,hours for the following 5 days), azithromycin (500\,mg orally for 5 days. Eligible patients were allocated at a 2 calcifediol:1 no calcifediol ratio through electronic randomization on the day of admission to take oral calcifediol (0.532\,mg), or not. Patients in the calcifediol treatment group continued with oral calcifediol (0.266\,mg) on day 3 and 7, and then weekly until discharge or ICU admission. Outcomes of effectiveness included rate of ICU admission and deaths. Results Of 50 patients treated with calcifediol, one required admission to the ICU (2\%), while of 26 untreated patients, 13 required admission (50\%) p value X2 Fischer test p\,{$<$}\,0.001. Univariate Risk Estimate Odds Ratio for ICU in patients with Calcifediol treatment versus without Calcifediol treatment: 0.02 (95\%CI 0.002-0.17). Multivariate Risk Estimate Odds Ratio for ICU in patients with Calcifediol treatment vs Without Calcifediol treatment ICU (adjusting by Hypertension and T2DM): 0.03 (95\%CI: 0.003-0.25). Of the patients treated with calcifediol, none died, and all were discharged, without complications. The 13 patients not treated with calcifediol, who were not admitted to the ICU, were discharged. Of the 13 patients admitted to the ICU, two died and the remaining 11 were discharged. Conclusion Our pilot study demonstrated that administration of a high dose of Calcifediol or 25-hydroxyvitamin D, a main metabolite of vitamin D endocrine system, significantly reduced the need for ICU treatment of patients requiring hospitalization due to proven COVID-19. Calcifediol seems to be able to reduce severity of the disease, but larger trials with groups properly matched will be required to show a definitive answer.},

In Belgium, off-label use of low-dose HCQ (total 2400 mg over 5 days) was recommended for hospitalised patients with COVID-19. We conducted a retrospective analysis of in-hospital mortality in the Belgian national COVID-19 hospital surveillance data. Patients treated either with HCQ monotherapy and supportive care (HCQ group) were compared with patients treated with supportive care only (no-HCQ group) using a competing risks proportional hazards regression with discharge alive as competing risk, adjusted for demographic and clinical features with robust standard errors. Of 8075 patients with complete discharge data on 24 May 2020 and diagnosed before 1 May 2020, 4542 received HCQ in monotherapy and 3533 were in the no-HCQ group. Death was reported in 804/4542 (17.7\%) and 957/3533 (27.1\%), respectively. In the multivariable analysis, mortality was lower in the HCQ group compared with the no-HCQ group [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR)~=~0.684, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.617\textendash 0.758].

Therefore, we assessed the effects of erythromycin in two dosages (250 and 500 mg per os four times a day) on esophageal pH and pressure profiles in reflux patients using prolonged ambulatory monitoring systems. Studies were blinded, placebo-controlled with randomized crossover design. Patients took each drug for three days prior to studies, with erythromycin serum levels obtained the day of esophageal studies. Erythromycin 250 mg four times a day had no effect on esophageal contraction pressures or peristalsis during the day or meal periods. In the supine position, however, erythromycin significantly (P = 0.012) decreased esophageal contraction velocity and showed a strong trend (P = 0.059) towards increasing the percentage of peristaltic waves. Despite these potentially beneficial effects on esophageal clearance, no significant difference in acid exposure times during 24-hr pH studies were observed between placebo and low-dose erythromycin. High-dose erythromycin (500 mg four times a day) was associated with drug levels in the typical antibiotic efficacy range (normal 1-3 micrograms/ml; patients 1.7-7.0 micrograms/ml), but, here again, there was no significant difference in all acid reflux parameters between placebo and erythromycin phases. Therefore, "standard" doses of erythromycin have no important clinical effects on esophageal pressures or acid reflux parameters.},

  abstract = {Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL) and abetalipoproteinemia (ABL) are rare diseases that cause hypocholesterolemia. Studying FHBL and ABL is essential to furthering the field of cholesterol research and has provided many therapeutic targets for hypercholesterolemia. ABL is an autosomal, recessive disease caused by a mutation in MTP, a chaperone protein in the ER that helps fold nascent apoB and transfers lipids onto apoB. FHBL is an autosomal, codominant disease caused by a mutation in APOB, which usually causes a truncated apoB with loss-of-function. ABL and homozygous FHBL have the same clinical symptoms: steatorrhea, neurological dysfunction, vision problems, and non-alcoholic fatty liver. Implementing a low-fat diet routine along with vitamin supplementations will ameliorate most symptoms except for hepatic steatosis. Both ABL and FHBL carry a reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases due to the reduction of atherosclerosis.    Many new therapeutic targets for hypercholesterolemia have been inspired by FHBL and ABL. Lomitapide is an MTP (microsomal triglyceride transfer protein) inhibitor that mimics ABL's mutant mechanism. Mipomersen is an apoB synthesis inhibitor, which mimics FHBL's mutant mechanism. The purpose of both drugs is to treat familial hypercholesterolemia. This literature review suggests other targets: a molecule to permanently bind apoB to MTP which mimics an FHBL mutation, a molecule to prevent PDI from binding to the large M subunit in the heterodimer MTP, and a method to truncate apoB to mimic FHBL mutations. Two new recently-discovered diseases have similar phenotypes as ABL and FHBL: PCSK9 deficiency and familial combined hypolipidemia. Both cause hypocholesterolemia. However, PCSK9 does not have the negative systemic effects such as steatorrhea and neurological dysfunction. In addition, no fatty liver develops. More research into these new diseases can contribute to the field of hypocholesterolemia, which provides new therapeutic targets for hypercholesterolemia.},

We hypothesize that study interventions (risk stratification with ENDPAC and imaging with Computerized Tomography (CT) scan) in NOD will identify earlier stage PDAC.

Eligible subjects will be identified through passive surveillance of electronic medical records and eligible study participants randomized 1:1 to the Intervention or Observation arm. The sample size is 12,500 subjects. The ENDPAC score will be calculated only in those randomized to the Intervention arm, with 50\% (n~=~3125) expected to have a high ENDPAC score. Consenting subjects in the high ENDPAC group will undergo CT imaging for PDAC detection and an estimate of potential harm. The effectiveness and efficacy evaluation will compare proportions of late stage PDAC between Intervention and Observation arm per randomization assignment or per protocol, respectively, with a planned interim analysis.

Manoeuvres which can increase vagal tone have been sought both in the normal subject and in patients with heart disease. We have studied the autonomic effect of various recumbent positions, namely the supine, left lateral decubitus and right lateral decubitus positions, in healthy subjects by using spectral heart rate variability analysis. Both time- and frequency-domain measures were calculated and compared between the three recumbent positions. The normalised high-frequency power was used as the index of cardiac vagal activity, the normalised low-frequency power as the index of cardiac sympathetic activity and the low-frequency power/high-frequency power ratio as the index of sympathovagal balance. The normalised high-frequency power is highest in the right lateral decubitus position, followed in decreasing order by left lateral decubitus and supine positions. The low-frequency power/high-frequency power ratio has the reversed trend as compared with that of the normalised high-frequency power. These results suggest that cardiac vagal activity is greatest when the right lateral decubitus position is adopted.},

The aims of this study are therefore to estimate the dwelling times of adenoma\textendash carcinoma sequence by adenoma size and histological type, taking de novo carcinoma into account. The efficacy of polypectomy was therefore estimated making allowance for two pathways. A case\textendash cohort design, underpinning a cohort with 13\,908 subjects (including 10\,496 normal subjects, 2652 polyps, 760 colorectal cancers) who underwent the first examination of colonoscopy between 1979 and 1998, was devised to estimate parameters associated with two opposing theories by randomly selecting 305 normal subjects, 300 patients with polyps, and 116 colorectal cancers from the cohort. All the 2652 polyps were linked to national cancer registry to ascertain 25 invasive carcinomas after polypectomy. For the five-state model associated with adenoma size, dwelling times of small (0.6\textendash 1\,cm) and large adenoma ({$>$}1\,cm) are 7.75 and 5.27 years for the model without considering de novo, and 17.48 and 15.90 years for the model taking de novo carcinoma into account. Similar findings are observed for the model associated with histological type. The estimated proportions of de novo carcinoma are 31.87\% from the model by adenoma size and 27.81\% from the model by histological type. Compared to size less than 5\,mm, patients with adenoma size between 6 and 10\,mm and patients with adenoma size larger than 1\,cm have 2.17-fold (0.67\textendash 10.74) and 4.25-fold (1.23\textendash 14.70), respectively, for the risk of malignant transformation. There are similar findings for the model by histological type. The estimates of overall efficacy of colonoscopy in reducing CRC is 73\% for the model allowing for de novo carcinoma and 88\% for the model without considering de novo carcinoma theory. The efficacy of diminutive adenoma and small adenoma increases with follow-up years, whereas the efficacy of large adenoma decreases with follow-up years. In conclusion, about 30\% of cancers arising from de novo sequence are demonstrated. This finding, together with the adenoma\textendash carcinoma sequence associated with adenoma size and histological type, is important for the estimation of dwelling times, the efficacy of colonoscopy, and the surveillance of polyp after polypectomy.},

Although a poor prognosis has been mentioned in previously reported patients, the precise pathomechanism and clinical significance are still unknown. Patients and methods: We report four patients with ocular salt-and-pepper pain, and review the clinical course, neuroimaging and prognosis in another eight patients reported in the literature. Results: In our series, they were three men and one woman, and their underlying cause was pontine hemorrhage; hypertensive hemorrhage in three and cavernous hemangioma in one patient, respectively. In these 12 salt-and-pepper patients, the identifiable etiology was exclusively brainstem stroke. Lifethreatening or disable neurological deterioration ensued within 24 h after pain onset in all patients. Their ocular pain subsided rapidly after neurological deterioration occurred. A dual excitation of nociceptive quinothalamic pain fiber and disinhibition of trigeminosensory system from pontine reticular formation and cerulotrigeminospinal circuit may be responsible for this pain. Conclusion: In clinical practice, ocular salt-and-pepper pain in quiet eyes should be alerted for intracranial pathology and neurological deterioration until underlying cause is identified. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Phytosterols (PSs) are a group of plant derived steroid alcohols, with wide occurrence in vegetables and fruits. They are integral components of plant cell membranes, having stabilizing effects on phospholipids bilayer, just like cholesterol in animal cell membranes. Structural resemblance of PSs with cholesterol enables them to displace low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the human intestine. Protective effects of PSs against cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), colon and breast cancer developments have been widely documented. Several reports have been published on the potential dietary intake of common PSs, such as {$\beta$}-sitosterol, stigmasterol and campesterol, and their safety concerns. Ability of PSs to reduce cholesterol levels and risks associated with heart problems has made them a class of favorite food supplements. Nowadays functional foods supplemented with PSs have become an alternative and healthy tool to lower LDL-cholesterol levels in a natural way. However, excessive use of PSs has been observed to develop premature coronary artery disease in phytosterolemic patients, high risk of atherosclerotic CVDs, myocardial infarction and even impaired endothelial functions. This manuscript will highlight the recent developments in PSs with particular focus on their role as dietary supplements and in treatment of various heart- and cholesterol-related ailments. Recently explored side effects of PSs will also be discussed.},

Typical symptoms include flushing, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, hypotension, and collapse during or after exercise. The far best described entity within EIA is food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA), where symptoms only occur in combination with food intake. Frequency and predictability of symptoms vary, and some patients experience symptoms only if exercise is accompanied by other co-factorsAreas covered: In the present review, we aimed to provide an overview of EIA, diagnostic workup, causes, management and discuss areas in need of further research.Expert opinion: Though rare, EIA is an entity that all allergists and practicing physicians should recognize. The pathophysiological and immunological mechanisms of EIA are largely unknown. Management is centered upon avoidance of eliciting factors, where emergency plans are individualized, except a mandatory prescription of an adrenaline auto-injector.},

In this study, we investigated the risks of gallstone occurrence during a 5-year follow-up period after an appendectomy, using a population-based dataset. We used data from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005. The exposed cohort included 4916 patients who underwent an appendectomy. The unexposed cohort was retrieved by randomly selecting 4916 patients matched with the exposed cohort in terms of sex, age, and year. We individually tracked each patient for a 5-year period to identify those who received a diagnosis of gallstones during the follow-up period. Cox proportional hazard regressions were performed for the analysis. During the 5-year follow-up period, the incidence rate per 1000 person-years was 4.71 for patients who had undergone an appendectomy, compared to a rate of 2.59 for patients in the unexposed cohort (p{$<$}0.001). Patients who had undergone an appendectomy were independently associated with a 1.79 (95\% CI = 1.29\textasciitilde 2.48)-fold increased risk of being diagnosed with gallstones during the 5-year follow-up period. We found that among female patients, the adjusted hazard ratio of gallstones was 2.25 (95\% CI = 1.41\textasciitilde 3.59) for patients who underwent an appendectomy compared to unexposed patients. However, for male patients, we failed to observe an increased hazard for gallstones among patients who underwent an appendectomy compared to unexposed patients. We found an increased risk of a subsequent gallstone diagnosis within 5 years after an appendectomy.},

Given that causes of dysphagia differ from patient to patient, individualized treatment plans tailored toward patients' specific conditions are needed. Here we present a case of an elderly woman with upper neck stiffness and dysphagia sought chiropractic treatment. Radiographic findings suggested cervical spondylosis with a vertical atlantoaxial subluxation. Following 20 sessions of chiropractic treatment, the patient experienced complete relief from neck problems and difficulty in swallowing. Rhythmic swallowing movements are controlled by a central pattern-generating circuit of the brain stem. In this case, the brain stem could have been compressed by the odontoid process of the axis due to C1/2 instability. Cervicogenic dysphagia is a cervical cause of difficulty in swallowing. Cervical complaints in the context of dysphagia are mostly under-estimated. A high degree of clinical suspicion is pivotal in timely intervention.},

Eighteen moderately trained males (age 23.8 {$\pm$} 2.1 years) consuming their HD (48 {$\pm$} 13\% carbohydrate, 17 {$\pm$} 3\% protein, 35 {$\pm$} 9\% fat) were assigned to 2 groups. One group was asked to remain on their HD, while the other was asked to switch to a non-standardized VLCHF diet (8 {$\pm$} 3\% carbohydrate, 29 {$\pm$} 15\% protein, 63 {$\pm$} 13\% fat) for 4 weeks. Participants performed graded exercise tests (GXT) before and after the experiment, and an HIIT session (5x3min, work/rest 2:1, passive recovery, total time 34min) before, and after 2 and 4 weeks. Heart rate (HR), oxygen uptake ({\.V}O2), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), maximal fat oxidation rates (Fatmax) and blood lactate were measured. Total time to exhaustion (TTE) and maximal {\.V}O2 ({\.V}O2max) in the GXT increased in both groups, but between-group changes were trivial (ES {$\pm$} 90\% CI: -0.1 {$\pm$} 0.3) and small (0.57 {$\pm$} 0.5), respectively.

  abstract = {Hemicrania continua is an uncommon primary headache disorder, characterized by continuous unilateral pain, where pain exacerbations are associated with cranial autonomic features. The hallmark of this condition is the absolute response to indometacin. We describe the phenotype of this condition in a large series of patients. Thirty-six (92\%) patients had side-locked pain and 3 (8\%) had side-alternating pain. The majority (82\%) of the patients had the chronic (unremitting) form and the severity range of background pain was 1-10 out of 10 on verbal rating scale, with a mean of 6.5. Thirty-eight (97\%) of the patients rated the painful exacerbations between 6.5 and 10 with a mean of 9 and 28 (71\%) described their severe pain as excruciating. Of the cohort, 97\% had at least one cranial autonomic feature during exacerbations: 73\% had lacrimation, 51\% nasal congestion, 46\% conjunctival injection and 40\% ptosis and facial flushing. Other cranial autonomic features included rhinorrhoea, forehead/facial sweating, itching eye, eyelid oedema, sense of aural fullness and periaural swelling, miosis, mydriasis and swelling of the cheek and face. Thirty-one (79\%) had phonophobia, which was unilateral in 14 (48\%); 29 (74\%) had photophobia, which was unilateral in 14 (48\%); and 27 (69\%) had motion sensitivity. In addition, about two-thirds were agitated or restless, or both, and about one-quarter were aggressive, mainly verbally, with severe pain. All patients had a positive placebo-controlled indometacin test (100-200 mg intramuscularly) or a positive oral indometacin trial, or both. We suggest the International Headache Society criteria be revised to remove the absence of side-shift pain as a criterion. Furthermore, revised criteria should encompass a more extensive range of cranial autonomic features and consider pain as fluctuating with moderate, severe and very severe intensity. Currently the sine qua non for hemicrania continua is a response to indometacin. Since there is no reliable clinical marker of that response, we recommend an indometacin test, either orally or by injection, for any patient with unilateral pain, with or without cranial autonomic symptoms.},

In real clinical settings, longitudinal LDL-C data are often available through the electronic health record. It is unknown whether genetic testing for FH variants provides additional risk-stratifying information once longitudinal LDL-C is considered. Methods: We used the extensive electronic health record data available through the Million Veteran Program to conduct a nested case-control study. The primary outcome was coronary artery disease, derived from electronic health record codes for acute myocardial infarction and coronary revascularization. Incidence density sampling was used to match case/control exposure windows, defined by the date of the first LDL-C measurement to the date of the first coronary artery disease code of the index case. Adjustments for the first, maximum, or mean LDL-C were analyzed. FH variants in LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9 were assessed by custom genotype array. Results: In a cohort of 23 091 predominantly prevalent cases at enrollment and 230 910 matched controls, FH variant carriers had an increased risk for coronary artery disease (odds ratio [OR], 1.53 [95\% CI, 1.24\textendash 1.89]). Adjusting for mean LDL-C led to the greatest attenuation of the risk estimate, but significant risk remained (odds ratio, 1.33 [95\% CI, 1.08\textendash 1.64]). The degree of attenuation was not affected by the number and the spread of LDL-C measures available. Conclusions: The risk associated with carrying an FH variant cannot be fully captured by the LDL-C data available in the electronic health record, even when considering multiple LDL-C measurements spanning more than a decade.},

Methods: The participant in this study was an adult male (age 41 years; mass 69 kg; height 173 cm). During the 72 h, data were collected every 6 h, involving a baseline (pre-deprivation). We monitored various parameters: Oxidative Stress (D-Rom and Bap test), Psychological Responses (test POMS and Measure of Global Stress), Metabolic expenditure (kJ) using a metabolic holter, EEG records, Cortisol, and Catecholamines level. Results: An interesting result was observed in the post-test phase, when a brief moment of deep sleep and total absence of a very deep sleep occurred, while an almost normal condition occurred in the pre-test sleep. Conclusion: During the 72-h sleep deprivation, no psycho-physiological stress was recorded. The participant has remained within the threshold of well-being. Only a peak was recorded during the 66th hour, but it was within the wellness threshold.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antibiotic therapy has been proposed as an alternative to surgery for the treatment of appendicitis. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, nonblinded, noninferiority, randomized trial comparing antibiotic therapy (10-day course) with appendectomy in patients with appendicitis at 25 U.S. centers. The primary outcome was 30-day health status, as assessed with the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire (scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating better health status; noninferiority margin, 0.05 points). Secondary outcomes included appendectomy in the antibiotics group and complications through 90 days; analyses were prespecified in subgroups defined according to the presence or absence of an appendicolith. RESULTS: In total, 1552 adults (414 with an appendicolith) underwent randomization; 776 were assigned to receive antibiotics (47\% of whom were not hospitalized for the index treatment) and 776 to undergo appendectomy (96\% of whom underwent a laparoscopic procedure). Antibiotics were noninferior to appendectomy on the basis of 30-day EQ-5D scores (mean difference, 0.01 points; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -0.001 to 0.03). In the antibiotics group, 29\% had undergone appendectomy by 90 days, including 41\% of those with an appendicolith and 25\% of those without an appendicolith. Complications were more common in the antibiotics group than in the appendectomy group (8.1 vs. 3.5 per 100 participants; rate ratio, 2.28; 95\% CI, 1.30 to 3.98); the higher rate in the antibiotics group could be attributed to those with an appendicolith (20.2 vs. 3.6 per 100 participants; rate ratio, 5.69; 95\% CI, 2.11 to 15.38) and not to those without an appendicolith (3.7 vs. 3.5 per 100 participants; rate ratio, 1.05; 95\% CI, 0.45 to 2.43). The rate of serious adverse events was 4.0 per 100 participants in the antibiotics group and 3.0 per 100 participants in the appendectomy group (rate ratio, 1.29; 95\% CI, 0.67 to 2.50). CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of appendicitis, antibiotics were noninferior to appendectomy on the basis of results of a standard health-status measure. In the antibiotics group, nearly 3 in 10 participants had undergone appendectomy by 90 days. Participants with an appendicolith were at a higher risk for appendectomy and for complications than those without an appendicolith.

The NS variants, although individually rare, are cumulatively frequent and influence quantitative traits, such as plasma lipoprotein levels. Here, we use the NS variant technique to demonstrate that genetic variation in NPC1L1 contributes to variability in cholesterol absorption and plasma levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs). The ratio of plasma campesterol (a plant sterol) to lathosterol (a cholesterol precursor) was used to estimate relative cholesterol absorption in a population-based study. Nonsynonymous sequence variations in NPC1L1 were five times more common in low absorbers (n = 26 of 256) than in high absorbers (n = 5 of 256) (P {$<$} 0.001). The rare variants identified in low absorbers were found in 6\% of 1,832 African-Americans and were associated with lower plasma levels of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) (96 {$\pm$} 36 mg/dl vs. 105 {$\pm$} 36 mg/dl; P = 0.005). These data, together with prior findings, reveal a genetic architecture for LDL-C levels that does not conform to current models for quantitative traits and indicate that a significant fraction of genetic variance in LDL-C is due to multiple alleles with modest effects that are present at low frequencies in the population.},

We examined the effect of DNA-sequence variations that reduce plasma levels of LDL cholesterol on the incidence of coronary events in a large population. Methods We compared the incidence of CHD (myocardial infarction, fatal CHD, or coronary revascularization) over a 15-year interval in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study according to the presence or absence of sequence variants in the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 serine protease gene (PCSK9) that are associated with reduced plasma levels of LDL cholesterol. Results Of the 3363 black subjects examined, 2.6 percent had nonsense mutations in PCSK9; these mutations were associated with a 28 percent reduction in mean LDL cholesterol and an 88 percent reduction in the risk of CHD (P = 0.008 for the reduction; hazard ratio, 0.11; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.81; P = 0.03). Of the 9524 white subjects examined, 3.2 percent had a sequence variation in PCSK9 that was associated with a 15 percent reduction in LDL cholesterol and a 47 percent reduction in the risk of CHD (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.79; P = 0.003).

  abstract = {Six normal men were fed formula diets containing either highly saturated fat (cocoa butter, iodine value 32) or polyunsaturated fat (corn oil, iodine value 125). The sterol balance technique was used to compare the changes in serum cholesterol concentration with the excretion of fecal steroids. The method used for the analysis of fecal steroids was chemical, with a final identification and quantification by gas-liquid chromatography. It was confirmed that the chemical method for fecal steroid analysis was accurate and reproducible., The three dietary periods were each 3 wk in length. In sequence, cocoa butter (period I), corn oil, and cocoa butter (period III) were fed at 40\% of the total calories. All diets were cholesterol free, contained similar amounts of plant sterols, and were identical in other nutrients., Corn oil had a hypocholesterolemic effect. Mean serum cholesterol concentrations were 222 mg/100 ml (cocoa butter, period I), 177 during corn oil, and 225 after the return to cocoa butter. Individual fecal steroids were determined from stools pooled for 7 days. Both neutral steroids and bile acids were altered significantly by dietary polyunsaturated fat. The change in bile acid excretion was considerably greater than the change in neutral steroids. Corn oil caused a greater fecal excretion of both deoxycholic and lithocholic acids. The total mean excretion (milligrams per day) of fecal steroids was 709 for cocoa butter (period I), 915 for corn oil, and 629 for the second cocoa butter period., The enhanced total fecal steroid excretion by the polyunsaturated fat of corn oil created a negative cholesterol balance vis-\`a-vis the saturated fat of cocoa butter. The hypocholesterolemic effect of polyunsaturated fat was associated with total fecal sterol excretion twice greater than the amount of cholesterol calculated to leave the plasma. This finding suggested possible loss of cholesterol from the tissues as well.},

  abstract = {Purpose To assess efficacy and safety of chloroquine (CQ)/hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for treatment or prophylaxis of COVID-19 in adult humans. Materials and methods MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE and two pre-print repositories (bioRxiv, medRxiv) were searched from inception to 8th June 2020 for RCTs and nonrandomized studies (retrospective and prospective, including single-arm, studies) addressing the use of CQ/HCQ in any dose or combination for COVID-19. Results Thirty-two studies were included (6 RCTs, 26 nonrandomized, 29,192 participants). Two RCTs had high risk, two `some concerns' and two low risk of bias (Rob2). Among nonrandomized studies with comparators, nine had high risk and five moderate risk of bias (ROBINS-I). Data synthesis was not possible. Low and moderate risk of bias studies suggest that treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 with CQ/HCQ may not reduce risk of death, compared to standard care. High dose regimens or combination with macrolides may be associated with harm. Postexposure prophylaxis may not reduce the rate of infection but the quality of the evidence is low. Conclusions Patients with COVID-19 should be treated with CQ/HCQ only if monitored and within the context of high quality RCTs. High quality data about efficacy/safety are urgently needed.},

In managing patients at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) to LDL target levels, it is unclear whether LDL cholesterol provides the optimum measure of residual risk and adequacy of LDL lowering treatment. Objective To compare the ability of alternative measures of LDL to provide CVD risk discrimination at relatively low levels consistent with current therapeutic targets. Methods Concentrations of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-HDL cholesterol (non-HDL-C) were measured chemically and LDL particle number (LDL-P) and VLDL particle number (VLDL-P) were measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in 3066 middle-aged white participants (53\% women) without CVD in the Framingham Offspring cohort. The main outcome measure was incidence of first CVD event. Results At baseline, the cholesterol content per LDL particle was negatively associated with triglycerides and positively associated with LDL-C. On follow-up (median 14.8 yrs), 265 men and 266 women experienced a CVD event. In multivariable models adjusting for non-lipid CVD risk factors, LDL-P was related more strongly to future CVD in both sexes than LDL-C or non-HDL-C. Subjects with a low level of LDL-P ({$<$}25th percentile) had a lower CVD event rate (59 events per 1000 person-years) than those with an equivalently low level of LDL-C or non-HDL-C (81 and 74 events per 1000 person-years, respectively). Conclusions In a large community-based sample, LDL-P was a more sensitive indicator of low CVD risk than either LDL-C or non-HDL-C, suggesting a potential clinical role for LDL-P as a goal of LDL management.},

In patients with hypoglycemia without diabetes mellitus, we recommend the following strategy.

In the absence of these causes, the differential diagnosis narrows to accidental, surreptitious, or even malicious hypoglycemia or endogenous hyperinsulinism. In patients suspected of having endogenous hyperinsulinism, measure plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, {$\beta$}-hydroxybutyrate, and circulating oral hypoglycemic agents during an episode of hypoglycemia and measure insulin antibodies. Insulin or insulin secretagogue treatment of diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of hypoglycemia. We recommend the practice of hypoglycemia risk factor reduction\textemdash addressing the issue of hypoglycemia, applying the principles of intensive glycemic therapy, and considering both the conventional risk factors and those indicative of compromised defenses against falling plasma glucose concentrations\textemdash in persons with diabetes.},

  abstract = {The effects of varying high intensity interval training (HIIT) and sprint interval training (SIT) frequency on 1.5 mile (2.4km) run performance in Air Force ROTC cadets were studied. Twenty-seven cadets (21.6 {$\pm$} 2.8 years) were stratified then randomly assigned to 3 groups: a high frequency group (HF) that performed HIIT/SIT 3x week, a low frequency group (LF) that performed HIIT/SIT 2x week, and a continuous training group (CG) that performed moderate intensity training 3x week. HIIT workouts consisted of 4 x 3 min intervals at 90-100\% of velocity at maximal oxygen consumption (vVO2 max) with 4 min of active recovery between sets. SIT workouts consisted of 4 x 30s all out sprints with 4 min active recovery between sets. Baseline 1.5 mile run performance was measured, then retested at 6 and 10 weeks. At the end of 6 weeks, all groups significantly improved in mean 1.5 mile run time (LF, 7.3\% + 4.2, p{$<$}0.001; HF, 9.7\% + 3.5, p{$<$}0.001; CG, 8.7\% + 4.8, p{$<$}0.001). No significant differences between groups were found at any point in time (p{$>$}0.05). Additional workouts beyond the 6-week point yielded no significant gains in run performance for any group. In conclusion, 2 days per week of combined HIIT/SIT training was as effective at improving 1.5 mile run performance as either 3 days/week of HIIT/SIT or continuous training, and the majority of initial performance gains from HIIT were achieved within the first 6 weeks of training.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare muscular fitness, anthropometric, and cardiorespiratory fitness outcomes between personalized, adaptive resistance training (ARX) and traditional moderate-intensity resistance exercise (MI-RE). Methods: Apparently healthy men and women (N=45) who reported no resistance training within the previous six months were randomized to a non-exercise control group or one of two resistance exercise training treatment groups (MI-RE or ARX). Measurements of all primary (muscular fitness) and secondary (anthropometric and cardiorespiratory) outcomes were obtained both before and after the 12wk resistance training intervention. Additionally, measures of the primary outcome variable (muscular fitness) were also obtained at the 6wk midpoint. Muscular fitness was assessed by one-repetition maximum (1RM) and five-repetition maximum (5RM) testing for 10 different resistance training exercises. Results: Percentage body fat and cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) improved significantly (p {$<$} 0.05) following 12wk resistance training in both groups; however, these improvements were more pronounced (p {$<$} 0.05) in the ARX group. Furthermore, similar findings were also observed for changes in weight and waist circumference across the 12wk intervention with both MI-RE and ARX groups showing favorable reductions, with the ARX group exhibiting superior changes. At 6wk (i.e., midpoint) and 12wk, all 1RM and 5RM measures for all resistance exercises, were significantly greater (p {$<$} 0.05) relative to the control group. In the ARX treatment group, the baseline to 12wk {$\increment$} in all 1RM and 5RM measures were significantly greater (p {$<$} 0.05) to those in the control and MIRE treatment group, with the exception (p {$>$} 0.05) of the MI-RE baseline to 12wk {$\increment$} in leg press 5RM, tricep extension 1RM and 5RM, and bicep curl 5RM. Conclusion: The tremendous potential for different modalities of evidence-based exercise programming to enhance training efficacy warrants ongoing scientific inquiry. Given that `lack of time' is the most often cited reason for not exercising regularly, this study aimed to provide preliminary evidence that extended application of the reduced exertion high intensity training (REHIT) paradigm from aerobic to resistance exercise using technology in the form of the ARX, which permitted personalized, effective, and safe programming. Collectively, these findings have the potential to provide exercise professionals with another important training paradigm to assist individuals with achieving their health and fitness goals.},

The population included 85 healthy subjects with the different I405V genotypes (35 II, 36 IV, and 14 VV) assigned to two consecutive 28-day experimental period. All subjects consumed a high-P:S with P:S of 1.2 for the first period and a low-P:S with a P:S of 0.3 for the next 28-day period. At the first and end of each dietary period, serum lipid, lipoprotein, and CETP concentrations were measured. At screening, lipid or lipoprotein concentrations were not significantly different among CETP I405V genotype groups. After the low-P:S diet, subjects carrying V allele had greater reduction in apoA-I and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) than subjects with II genotype. A genotype-by-diet interaction effect was observed on apoA-I (p=0.016) concentrations. In conclusion, the CETP I405V polymorphism contributes to the unfavorable changes of apoA-I and HDL-C when a high-P:S diet was replaced with a low-P:S diet.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk of lung cancer associated with exposure at home to the radioactive disintegration products of naturally occurring radon gas. DESIGN: Collaborative analysis of individual data from 13 case-control studies of residential radon and lung cancer. SETTING: Nine European countries. SUBJECTS: 7148 cases of lung cancer and 14,208 controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relative risks of lung cancer and radon gas concentrations in homes inhabited during the previous 5-34 years measured in becquerels (radon disintegrations per second) per cubic metre (Bq/m3) of household air. RESULTS: The mean measured radon concentration in homes of people in the control group was 97 Bq/m3, with 11\% measuring {$>$} 200 and 4\% measuring {$>$} 400 Bq/m3. For cases of lung cancer the mean concentration was 104 Bq/m3. The risk of lung cancer increased by 8.4\% (95\% confidence interval 3.0\% to 15.8\%) per 100 Bq/m3 increase in measured radon (P = 0.0007). This corresponds to an increase of 16\% (5\% to 31\%) per 100 Bq/m3 increase in usual radon--that is, after correction for the dilution caused by random uncertainties in measuring radon concentrations. The dose-response relation seemed to be linear with no threshold and remained significant (P = 0.04) in analyses limited to individuals from homes with measured radon {$<$} 200 Bq/m3. The proportionate excess risk did not differ significantly with study, age, sex, or smoking. In the absence of other causes of death, the absolute risks of lung cancer by age 75 years at usual radon concentrations of 0, 100, and 400 Bq/m3 would be about 0.4\%, 0.5\%, and 0.7\%, respectively, for lifelong non-smokers, and about 25 times greater (10\%, 12\%, and 16\%) for cigarette smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, though not separately, these studies show appreciable hazards from residential radon, particularly for smokers and recent ex-smokers, and indicate that it is responsible for about 2\% of all deaths from cancer in Europe.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY Weight loss diets often restrict either fat or carbohydrate, macronutrients that are sensed via distinct gut-brain pathways and differentially affect peripheral hormones and metabolism. To investigate whether reductions in dietary fat versus carbohydrate alter brain reward circuitry, we measured dopamine D2/3 receptor binding potential (D2BP) using PET and neural activity in response to visual food cues using fMRI in 17 inpatient adults with obesity during a eucaloric baseline diet and on the fifth day of isocaloric diets selectively reduced in either dietary fat or carbohydrate, in random order. Reduction of dietary fat, but not carbohydrate, decreased D2BP and decreased neural activity to food cues in brain reward regions. After the reduced fat diet, ad libitum intake shifted towards foods high in both fat and carbohydrates. These results suggest that dietary fat restriction increases tonic dopamine in brain reward regions thereby affecting food choice in ways that may hamper diet adherence. IN BRIEF Darcey et al. found that selective reduction of dietary fat, but not carbohydrate, resulted in changes in brain dopamine receptor binding potential and neural activity in response to food cues, consistent with increased tonic dopamine and resulting in greater subsequent consumption of rewarding foods high in both fat and carbohydrate. HIGHLIGHTSCompared to a eucaloric baseline diet, selective reduction of dietary fat, but not carbohydrate, significantly decreased both dopamine D2/3 receptor binding potential and neural activity to visual food cues in brain reward regions.Multimodal neuroimaging suggests that reduction of dietary fat, but not carbohydrate, increased tonic brain dopamine and influenced food choices in ways that may hamper diet adherence.},

The most common presentation was chest pain within 1\textendash 5 days after the second dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. All patients had an elevated troponin. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed late gadolinium enhancement consistent with myocarditis in 69\% of cases. All patients recovered clinically rapidly within 1\textendash 3 weeks. Most patients were treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for symptomatic relief, and 4 received intravenous immune globulin and corticosteroids. We speculate a possible causal relationship between vaccine administration and myocarditis. The data from our analysis confirms that all myocarditis and pericarditis cases are mild and resolve within a few days to few weeks. The bottom line is that the risk of cardiac complications among children and adults due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection far exceeds the minimal and rare risks of vaccination-related transient myocardial or pericardial inflammation.},

  abstract = {Heavy alcohol consumption has been associated with brain atrophy, neuronal loss, and poorer white matter fiber integrity. However, there is conflicting evidence on whether light-to-moderate alcohol consumption shows similar negative associations with brain structure. To address this, we examine the associations between alcohol intake and brain structure using multimodal imaging data from 36,678 generally healthy middle-aged and older adults from the UK Biobank, controlling for numerous potential confounds. Consistent with prior literature, we find negative associations between alcohol intake and brain macrostructure and microstructure. Specifically, alcohol intake is negatively associated with global brain volume measures, regional gray matter volumes, and white matter microstructure. Here, we show that~the negative associations between alcohol intake and brain macrostructure and microstructure are already~apparent in individuals consuming an average of only one to two daily alcohol units, and become stronger as alcohol intake increases.},

  abstract = {Previous reports have recommended the use of a "classic triad" of fever, spine pain, and neurologic deficits to diagnose spinal epidural abscess (SEA); however, the prognosis for complete recovery is poor once these deficits are present. This retrospective case-control study investigates the impact of diagnostic delays on outcome and explores the use of risk factor screening for early identification of SEA in a population of ED patients. Inpatients with a discharge diagnosis of SEA and a related ED visit before the admission were identified over a 10-year time period. In addition, a pool of ED patients presenting with a chief complaint of spine pain was generated; controls were hand-matched 2:1 to each SEA patient based on age and gender. Data regarding demographics, presence of risk factors, physical examination findings, laboratory and radiographic results, and clinical outcome were abstracted from medical records and entered into a database for further analysis. Patients with SEA were compared to matched controls with regard to the prevalence of risk factors and the "classic triad." We also explored the impact on outcome of diagnostic delays, defined as either: 1) multiple ED visits before diagnosis, or 2) admission without a diagnosis of SEA and {$>$}24 h to a definitive study. A total of 63 SEA patients were hand-matched to 126 controls with spine pain. Diagnostic delays were present in 75\% of SEA patients. Residual motor weakness was present in 45\% of these patients vs. only 13\% of patients without diagnostic delays (odds ratio 5.65, 95\% C.I. 1.15-27.71, p {$<$} 0.05). The "classic triad" of spine pain, fever, and neurologic abnormalities was present in 13\% of SEA patients and 1\% of controls during the initial visit (p {$<$} 0.01); one or more risk factors were present in 98\% of SEA patients and 21\% of controls (p {$<$} 0.01). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was more sensitive and specific than total white blood cell (WBC) count as a screen for SEA. In conclusion, diagnostic delays are common in patients with SEA, often leading to irreversible neurologic deficits. The use of risk factor assessment is more sensitive than the use of the classic diagnostic triad to screen ED patients with spine pain for SEA. The ESR may be a useful screening test before magnetic resonance imaging in selected patients.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: A spinal epidural abscess (SEA) is rare but potentially devastating if not diagnosed early. Unfortunately, diagnostic delays and associated neurological deficits are common. The objectives of this analysis were to explore the use of a novel clinical decision guideline to screen patients who present to the emergency department (ED) with spine pain for SEA and to determine the diagnostic test characteristics of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level in patients at risk for SEA. METHODS: This was a prospective, cohort analysis comparing the incidence of diagnostic delays and presence of motor deficits at the time of diagnosis before and after implementation of a novel decision guideline using risk factor assessment followed by ESR and CRP testing prior to definitive imaging. A delay was defined as either multiple ED visits or admission to a nonsurgical service without a diagnosis of SEA. A 9-month substudy was performed in all patients who presented to the ED with spine pain so that the diagnostic test characteristics of the ESR and CRP level could be defined. RESULTS: A total of 55 patients with an SEA in the 9-year control period and 31 patients with an SEA in the 5-year study period were identified. Diagnostic delays were observed in 46 (83.6\%) of 55 patients before guideline implementation versus 3 (9.7\%) of 31 after guideline implementation (p {$<$} 0.001). Motor deficits were present at the time of diagnosis in 45 (81.8\%) of 55 patients before guideline implementation versus 6 (19.4\%) of 31 after guideline implementation (p {$<$} 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of ESR in patients with an SEA risk factor were 100\% and 67\%, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed better test characteristics for ESR (area under curve 0.96) than for CRP (area under curve 0.81). CONCLUSIONS: A treatment guideline incorporating risk factor assessment followed by ESR and CRP testing was highly sensitive and moderately specific in identifying ED patients with SEA. A decrease in diagnostic delays and a lower incidence of motor deficits at the time of diagnosis was observed.},

  abstract = {The schola medica salernitana is considered the oldest medical school of modern civilization. Salerno's long medical tradition began during the Greco-Roman period in a Greek colony named Elea, where Parmenides decided to found a medical school. The fame of the school became more and more important during the 10th century, and it was best known in the 11th century. In the middle of 12th century, the school was at its apogee, and Salerno provided a notable contribution to the formulation of a medical curriculum for medieval universities. The most famous work of the Salernitan School was the Regimen Sanitatis Saleritanum, a Latin poem of rational, dietetic, and hygienic precepts, many of them still valid today. The school also produced a physician's reference book, with advice on how to treat a patient, a sort of code of conduct to help the physician to respect the patient and his or her relatives. The first science-based surgery appeared on the scene of the discredited medieval practice in Salerno, thanks to Roger of Salerno and his fellows. He wrote a book on surgery, called Rogerina or Post Mundi Fabricam, in which surgery from head to toe is described, with surprising originality. The important contribution to the School of Salerno made by women as female practitioners is outlined, and among them, Trotula de Ruggiero was the most renowned. The period when the School of Salerno, universally recognized as the forerunner of the modern universities, became a government academy was when Frederick II reigned over the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, as Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.},

  abstract = {Lipoprotein transport across the blood\textendash brain barrier (BBB) is of critical importance for the delivery of essential lipids to the brain cells. The occurrence of a low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor on the BBB has recently been demonstrated. To examine further the function of this receptor, we have shown using an in vitro model of the BBB, that in contrast to acetylated LDL, which does not cross the BBB, LDL is specifically transcytosed across the monolayer. The C7 monoclonal antibody, known to interact with the LDL receptor-binding domain, totally blocked the transcytosis of LDL, suggesting that the transcytosis is mediated by the receptor. Furthermore, we have shown that cholesterol-depleted astrocytes upregulate the expression of the LDL receptor at the BBB. Under these conditions, we observed that the LDL transcytosis parallels the increase in the LDL receptor, indicating once more that the LDL is transcytosed by a receptor-mediated mechanism. The nondegradation of the LDL during the transcytosis indicates that the transcytotic pathway in brain capillary endothelial cells is different from the LDL receptor classical pathway. The switch between a recycling receptor to a transcytotic receptor cannot be explained by a modification of the internalization signals of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor, since we have shown that LDL receptor messengers in growing brain capillary ECs (recycling LDL receptor) or differentiated cells (transcytotic receptor) are 100\% identical, but we cannot exclude posttranslational modifications of the cytoplasmic domain, as demonstrated for the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor. Preliminary studies suggest that caveolae are likely to be involved in the potential transport of LDL from the blood to the brain.},

A questionnaire was used to collect data on dietary practices. Mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC), triceps skinfold thickness (TSFT), and weight measurements were used to assess nutritional status. Slightly fewer than three-quarters (71\%) of the women craved one or more foods, whereas about two-thirds (65\%) avoided at least one food. Cereal foods, despite being staple foods in the area, were avoided by more women (41\%) than any other foods. Livestock products, which were scarce at the time of the study, were craved by more women (55\%) than any other foods. Comparisons using various anthropometric indicators revealed that women who avoided foods had significantly higher MUAC and TSFT than those who did not (p {$<$} .05), whereas there was no difference in nutritional status between women who craved foods and those who did not. However, those craving women who managed to get the desired foods had significantly higher weight gain (p {$<$} .05), but not significantly higher MUAC or TSFT, than those who did not. Aversion and craving were positively associated (?2 = 10.66, p {$<$} .001; odds ratio, 2.36). Thus, women who avoided foods were 2.4 times more likely to crave foods than those who did not avoid foods. This implies that aversion and craving are complementary processes geared towards ensuring optimal nutrition during pregnancy. Aversion results in the avoidance of monotonous diets, whereas craving calls for varied and nutritious foods. More research, however, is needed before such a conclusion is warranted.},

We sought to describe national patterns of alternative vaccination schedule use and the potential ``malleability'' of parents' current vaccination schedule choices. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional, Internet-based survey of a nationally representative sample of parents of children 6 months to 6 years of age. Bivariate and multivariate analyses determined associations between demographic and attitudinal factors and alternative vaccination schedule use. RESULTS: The response rate was 61\% (N ϭ 748). Of the 13\% of parents who reported following an alternative vaccination schedule, most refused only certain vaccines (53\%) and/or delayed some vaccines until the child was older (55\%). Only 17\% reported refusing all vaccines. In multivariate models, nonblack race and not having a regular health care provider for the child were the only factors significantly associated with higher odds of using an alternative schedule. A large proportion of alternative vaccinators (30\%) reported having initially followed the recommended vaccination schedule. Among parents following the recommended vaccination schedule, 28\% thought that delaying vaccine doses was safer than the schedule they used, and 22\% disagreed that the best vaccination schedule to follow was the one recommended by vaccination experts. CONCLUSIONS: More than 1 of 10 parents of young children currently use an alternative vaccination schedule. In addition, a large proportion of parents currently following the recommended schedule seem to be ``at risk'' for switching to an alternative schedule. Pediatrics 2011;128:848\textendash 856},

In our lipid clinics, 273 patients were selected on the basis of a severe hypercholesterolaemia (cholesterol above 95th percentile) and a family history of early cardiovascular disease. By molecular genetic test, 122 patients were classified as FH. Atherosclerosis was evaluated by the ultrasonographic measurement of intima-media thickness (IMT) in the carotid and femoral arteries. Despite the fact that non-FH individuals had a higher prevalence of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypertriglyceridaemia, FH individuals had significantly greater carotid and femoral IMT than non-FH patients: difference between carotid and femoral IMT, respectively, 0{$\cdot$}19 mm (95\% CI, 0{$\cdot$}08\textendash 0{$\cdot$}29; P {$<$} 0{$\cdot$}001) and 0{$\cdot$}20 mm (95\% CI, 0{$\cdot$}09\textendash 0{$\cdot$}35; P = 0{$\cdot$}001), respectively. These differences remained statistically significant after adjustment for the various risk factors as well as in sub-analysis restricted to the patients with LDL-cholesterol between 240 and 300 mg dL-1 (range with similar distribution in the two groups). When classified according to the severity of their mutations, FH individuals with null LDL receptor allele tended to have thicker carotid IMT than FH individuals carrying the LDL receptor-defective allele. Among patients with severe hypercholesterolaemia and a family history of early cardiovascular disease, the presence of a genetically ascertained FH is associated with a higher degree of atherosclerosis. This suggests that molecular genetic identification of FH may be helpful to evaluate better the coronary heart disease risk in these patients.},

We aim to describe here the various clinical presentations of this disease by examining eleven cases. Methods Electronic medical records of 11 patients with COVID-19 were collected and demographics, clinical manifestations, outcomes, key laboratory results, and radiological images are discussed. Results The clinical course of the eleven cases demonstrated the complexity of the COVID-19 profile with different clinical presentations. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic cases to patients with mild and severe symptoms, with or without pneumonia. Laboratory detection of the viral nucleic acid can yield false-negative results, and serological testing of virus specific IgG and IgM antibodies should be used as an alternative for diagnosis. Patients with common allergic diseases did not develop distinct symptoms and severe courses. Cases with a pre-existing condition of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or complicated with a secondary bacterial pneumonia were more severe. Conclusion All different clinical characteristics of COVID-19 should be taken into consideration to identify patients that need to be in strict quarantine for the efficient containment of the pandemic.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The causal agent for SARS is considered as a novel coronavirus that has never been described both in human and animals previously. The stability of SARS coronavirus in human specimens and in environments was studied. METHODS: Using a SARS coronavirus strain CoV-P9, which was isolated from pharyngeal swab of a probable SARS case in Beijing, its stability in mimic human specimens and in mimic environment including surfaces of commonly used materials or in household conditions, as well as its resistance to temperature and UV irradiation were analyzed. A total of 10(6) TCID50 viruses were placed in each tested condition, and changes of the viral infectivity in samples after treatments were measured by evaluating cytopathic effect (CPE) in cell line Vero-E6 at 48 h after infection. RESULTS: The results showed that SARS coronavirus in the testing condition could survive in serum, 1:20 diluted sputum and feces for at least 96 h, whereas it could remain alive in urine for at least 72 h with a low level of infectivity. The survival abilities on the surfaces of eight different materials and in water were quite comparable, revealing reduction of infectivity after 72 to 96 h exposure. Viruses stayed stable at 4 degrees C, at room temperature (20 degrees C) and at 37 degrees C for at least 2 h without remarkable change in the infectious ability in cells, but were converted to be non-infectious after 90-, 60- and 30-min exposure at 56 degrees C, at 67 degrees C and at 75 degrees C, respectively. Irradiation of UV for 60 min on the virus in culture medium resulted in the destruction of viral infectivity at an undetectable level. CONCLUSION: The survival ability of SARS coronavirus in human specimens and in environments seems to be relatively strong. Heating and UV irradiation can efficiently eliminate the viral infectivity.},

We herein review current data related to both statins and the Mediterranean diet.

On the contrary, we should acknowledge the inconsistencies of the cholesterol theory and recognize the proven benefits of a healthy lifestyle incorporating a Mediterranean diet to prevent CHD.},

They received two cycles of NuvaRing (21 subjects) or a COC (30 {$\mu$}g ethinylestradiol and 150 {$\mu$}g levonorgestrel, 19 subjects). NuvaRing was started on cycle day 5, COC on cycle day 1. Follicular diameter, endometrial thickness and FSH, LH, 17{$\beta$}-estradiol (E2) and progesterone concentrations were determined. Results: The median maximum follicular diameter (maxFD) was {$\leq$}11 mm during treatment. In the first treatment cycle the maxFD was lower in the COC than in the NuvaRing group, due to the different starting procedures. MaxFD were not different in the second treatment cycle. In both groups, E2 and progesterone levels remained low during treatment. Ovulations did not occur. Conclusions: In both groups, ovarian activity was adequately suppressed. Due to the different starting procedures, lower ovarian activity was observed in the COC group in the first treatment cycle. In the second cycle, ovarian suppression was comparable with NuvaRing and COC treatment. \textcopyright{} European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology 2004; all rights reserved.},

Methods We assessed serial colonoscopy findings from 54 persons from 29 pedigrees with pathogenic mutations in MSH2 or MLH1; we evaluated the development of colorectal neoplasia by age, sex, tumor location, and number (mean follow-up time=9.3 years, colonoscopy interval=1.7{$\pm$}1.2, 112 adenomas and 31 cancers). Differences in colorectal phenotype were analyzed by genotype and dwell time was calculated for advanced neoplasias. Results Among mutation carriers, the cumulative risk of colorectal neoplasia was 43\% by age 40 years and 72\% by 80 years. There were no statistically significant associations between time to development of colorectal neoplasia and sex or mutation type. Most female patients had left-sided neoplasms whereas most male patients developed right-sided lesions. The mean cumulative numbers of neoplastic lesions in patients was 1.3{$\pm$}0.5 by age 30 years and 7.6{$\pm$}6.8 by age 80 years. Polyp dwell time was 33.0{$\pm$}16.2 months and 35.2{$\pm$}22.3 months for advanced adenoma and colorectal cancer, respectively. The 5-year survival rate for patients with colorectal cancer was 96\%. Conclusions High percentages of individuals with pathogenic mutations in MSH2 of MLH1 develop colorectal neoplasia by age 40. Left-sided colorectal neoplasias are more frequent in female patients. The development of 3 or more colorectal neoplasms by age 30 years indicates a possible polyposis syndrome, rather than Lynch Syndrome. Polyp dwell time is short for advanced neoplasias, arguing for annual colonoscopic screening and surveillance.},

We conducted this meta-analysis to compare the safety of HCQ versus placebo. Methods Two authors independently searched PubMed and EMBASE databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adults comparing the adverse events (AEs) of HCQ versus placebo for any indication. Peto odds ratios (Peto ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated based on random-effects models. The heterogeneity (I2) was assessed using Cochran's Q test. Results Nine RCTs (eight were double-blind) with a total of 916 patients were included. HCQ caused significantly more skin pigmentation than placebo (Peto OR, 4.64; 95\% CI, 1.13 to 19.00; P-value~=~0.033; I2~=~0\%). The increase in other AEs did not reach statistical significance: rash (Peto OR, 1.11; 95\% CI, 0.3 to 3.77; P-value~=~0.03; I2~=~0\%); gastrointestinal AEs (Peto OR, 1.43; 95\% CI, 0.55 to 3.72; P-value~=~0.46; I2~=~15.17\%); headache (Peto OR, 1.94; 95\% CI, 0.65 to 5.78; P-value~=~0.23; I2~=~9.99\%); dizziness (Peto OR, 1.32; 95\% CI, 0.49 to 3.52; P-value~=~0.58; I2~=~0\%); fatigue (Peto OR, 2.13; 95\% CI, 0.76 to 5.98; P-value~=~0.15; I2~=~0\%); and visual AEs (Peto OR, 1.61; 95\% CI, 0.76 to 3.41; P-value~=~0.22; I2~=~0\%). Cardiac toxicity was not reported. Conclusions This meta-analysis of RCTs found a significantly higher risk of skin pigmentation in HCQ users versus placebo. More data are needed to evaluate HCQ in the context of COVID-19 treatment.},

Chronic pruritus is sometimes accompanied by pain, paresthesias, or altered sensation to touch. Objectives: To review the current literature with regards to the cause of NP and its most appropriate treatment. Methods: Comprehensive literature review using PubMed to inspect the available data on NP. Results: The most likely cause of NP is cutaneous nerve damage. Many therapies have been tried in the treatment of NP, mostly in small case studies. Conclusions: The published cases and studies suggest symptoms of NP are due to a cutaneous sensory neuropathy. Treatments addressing the condition as such are more successful than traditional itch therapies. In many cases, a simple explanation for the persistent pruritus is satisfactory for patients. For very distressing cases, therapy should address the condition as a benign sensory neuropathy. Further studies are needed to evaluate which treatments have the greatest potential for providing symptom relief.},

Diet-induced changes in Lp(a) were strongly correlated with changes in OxPL/apoB (P {$<$} 0.0001). The increases in plasma Lp(a) levels after the LFHC diet were also correlated with decreases in medium LDL particles (P {$<$} 0.01) and increases in very small LDL particles (P {$<$} 0.05). These results demonstrate that induction of increased levels of Lp(a) by an LFHC diet is associated with increases in OxPLs and with changes in LDL subclass distribution that may reflect altered metabolism of Lp(a) particles.},

Apolipoprotein B is also expressed in mammalian fetal membranes. To examine the consequences of apolipoprotein B deficiency in mice, we used gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem cells to generate mice containing an insertional disruption of the 5' region of the apolipoprotein B gene. Mice that were heterozygous for the disrupted apolipoprotein B allele had an approximately 20\% reduction in plasma cholesterol levels, markedly reduced plasma concentrations of the pre-beta and beta-migrating lipoproteins, and an approximately 70\% reduction in plasma apolipoprotein B levels. When fed a diet rich in fat and cholesterol, heterozygous mice were protected from diet-induced hypercholesterolemia; these mice, which constitute an animal model for hypobetalipoproteinemia, should be useful for studying the effects of decreased apolipoprotein B expression on atherogenesis. The breeding of heterozygous mice yielded no viable homozygous apolipoprotein B knockout mice. Most homozygous embryos were resorbed by midgestation (before gestational day 11.5); several embryos that survived until later in gestation exhibited exencephalus. The embryonic lethal phenotype was rescued by complementation with a human apolipoprotein B transgene--i.e., human apolipoprotein B transgenic mice that were homozygous for the murine apolipoprotein B knockout mutation were viable. Our findings indicate that apolipoprotein B plays an essential role in mouse embryonic development.},

  abstract = {Background: No targeted immunotherapies reverse type 1 diabetes in humans. However, in a rodent model of type 1 diabetes, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) reverses disease by restoring insulin secretion. Specifically, it stimulates innate immunity by inducing the host to produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which, in turn, kills disease-causing autoimmune cells and restores pancreatic beta-cell function through regeneration. Methodology/Principal Findings: Translating these findings to humans, we administered BCG, a generic vaccine, in a proofof-principle, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adults with long-term type 1 diabetes (mean: 15.3 years) at one clinical center in North America. Six subjects were randomly assigned to BCG or placebo and compared to self, healthy paired controls (n = 6) or reference subjects with (n = 57) or without (n = 16) type 1 diabetes, depending upon the outcome measure. We monitored weekly blood samples for 20 weeks for insulin-autoreactive T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and other autoantibodies, and C-peptide, a marker of insulin secretion. BCG-treated patients and one placebo-treated patient who, after enrollment, unexpectedly developed acute Epstein-Barr virus infection, a known TNF inducer, exclusively showed increases in dead insulin-autoreactive T cells and induction of Tregs. C-peptide levels (pmol/L) significantly rose transiently in two BCG-treated subjects (means: 3.49 pmol/L [95\% CI 2.95\textendash 3.8], 2.57 [95\% CI 1.65\textendash 3.49]) and the EBV-infected subject (3.16 [95\% CI 2.54\textendash 3.69]) vs.1.65 [95\% CI 1.55\textendash 3.2] in reference diabetic subjects. BCG-treated subjects each had more than 50\% of their C-peptide values above the 95th percentile of the reference subjects. The EBV-infected subject had 18\% of C-peptide values above this level. Conclusions/Significance: We conclude that BCG treatment or EBV infection transiently modified the autoimmunity that underlies type 1 diabetes by stimulating the host innate immune response. This suggests that BCG or other stimulators of host innate immunity may have value in the treatment of long-term diabetes.},

It will be difficult and costly to develop new drugs that target each of these viruses. Statins and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been effective in treating patients with sepsis, pneumonia and influenza, and a statin/ARB combination appeared to dramatically reduce mortality during the recent Ebola outbreak. These drugs target (among other things) the endothelial dysfunction found in all of these diseases. Most scientists work on new drugs that target viruses, and few accept the idea of treating the host response with generic drugs. A great deal of research will be needed to show conclusively that these drugs work, and this will require the support of public agencies and foundations. Investigators in developing countries should take an active role in this research. If the next Public Health Emergency of International Concern is caused by an emerging virus, a ``top down'' approach to developing specific new drug treatments is unlikely to be effective. However, a ``bottom up'' approach to treatment that targets the host response to these viruses by using widely available and inexpensive generic drugs could reduce mortality in any country with a basic health care system. In doing so, it would make an immeasurable contribution to global equity and global security.},

These investigations can be helpful to stratify risk, direct anesthetic choices, and guide postoperative management, but often are obtained because of protocol rather than medical necessity. The decision to order preoperative tests should be guided by the patient's clinical history, comorbidities, and physical examination findings. Patients with signs or symptoms of active cardiovascular disease should be evaluated with appropriate testing, regardless of their preoperative status. Electrocardiography is recommended for patients undergoing high-risk surgery and those undergoing intermediate-risk surgery who have additional risk factors. Patients undergoing low-risk surgery do not require electrocardiography. Chest radiography is reasonable for patients at risk of postoperative pulmonary complications if the results would change perioperative management. Preoperative urinalysis is recommended for patients undergoing invasive urologic procedures and those undergoing implantation of foreign material. Electrolyte and creatinine testing should be performed in patients with underlying chronic disease and those taking medications that predispose them to electrolyte abnormalities or renal failure. Random glucose testing should be performed in patients at high risk of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus. In patients with diagnosed diabetes, A1C testing is recommended only if the result would change perioperative management. A complete blood count is indicated for patients with diseases that increase the risk of anemia or patients in whom significant perioperative blood loss is anticipated. Coagulation studies are reserved for patients with a history of bleeding or medical conditions that predispose them to bleeding, and for those taking anticoagulants.

Objectives This study sought to identify predictors of subclinical atherosclerosis in CVRF-free individuals. Methods Participants from the PESA (Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis) study (n~=~4,184) without conventional CVRFs were evaluated (n~=~1,779; 45.0 {$\pm$} 4.1 years, 50.3\% women). CVRF freedom was defined as no current smoking and untreated blood pressure~{$<$}140/90~mm~Hg, fasting glucose~{$<$}126~mg/dl, total cholesterol~{$<$}240~mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)~{$<$}160~mg/dl, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol~{$\geq$}40~mg/dl. A~subgroup~with optimal CVRFs (n~=~740) was also defined as having blood pressure~{$<$}120/80~mm~Hg, fasting glucose~{$<$}100~mg/dl, glycosylated hemoglobin {$<$}5.7\%, and total cholesterol~{$<$}200~mg/dl. We evaluated ultrasound-detected carotid, iliofemoral, and abdominal aortic plaques; coronary artery calcification; serum biomarkers; and lifestyle. Adjusted odds ratios (with 95\% confidence interval) and ordinal logistic regression models were used. Results Subclinical atherosclerosis (plaque or coronary artery calcification) was present in 49.7\% of CVRF-free participants. Together with male sex and age, LDL-C was independently associated with atherosclerosis presence and extent, in both the CVRF-free and CVRF-optimal groups (odds ratio [\texttimes 10~mg/dl]: 1.14 to 1.18; p~{$<$} 0.01 for all). Atherosclerosis presence and extent was also associated in the CVRF-free group with glycosylated hemoglobin levels. Conclusions Many CVRF-free middle-aged individuals have atherosclerosis. LDL-C, even at levels currently considered normal, is independently associated with the presence and extent of early systemic atherosclerosis in the absence of major CVRFs. These findings support more effective LDL-C lowering for primordial prevention, even in individuals~conventionally considered at optimal risk.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of dietary caffeine intake and withdrawal on cerebral blood flow (CBF), as determined from a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty adults (16 men, four women; age range, 24-64 years) categorized as low (mean, 41 mg/d) or high (mean, 648 mg/d) caffeine users underwent quantitative flow-sensitive alternating inversion-recovery perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging twice: 90 minutes after a dose of caffeine (250 mg) on one day and after a dose of placebo on another day (randomized counterbalanced design). Doses were preceded by 30 hours of caffeine abstinence to induce withdrawal in high caffeine users. Quantitative CBF maps were gray matter (GM)\textendash white matter (WM) segmented and subjected to region-of-interest analysis to obtain mean CBF in WM, anterior circulation GM (AGM), and posterior circulation GM (PGM). By using two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance, regional CBF data were tested for within-subject differences between caffeine and placebo and for between-subject differences related to dietary caffeine habits. Linear regression was used to determine whether dietary caffeine use predicts CBF or CBF response to caffeine.RESULTS: Caffeine reduced CBF (P {$\leq$} .05) by 23\% (AGM, PGM) and 18\% (WM) in all subjects. Postplacebo (withdrawal) CBF in high caffeine users exceeded that in low users (P {$\leq$} .05) by 31\% (AGM) and 32\% (WM) (PGM, not significant). Mean postcaffeine CBF reduction in AGM was 26\% in high users versus 19\% in low users (P {$\leq$} .05; PGM and WM, not significant). Increasing caffeine consumption predicted higher CBF (P {$\leq$} .05) in all regions: r = 0.79 (AGM), 0.57 (PGM), and 0.76 (WM). Dietary caffeine use did not predict CBF response to caffeine.CONCLUSION: Dietary caffeine consumption and withdrawal are potential confounding variables in cerebral perfusion and functional MR imaging.\textcopyright{} RSNA, 2003},

Pain in a quiet eye can be the first sign of a vision-threatening condition, a more benign ophthalmologic condition, or a nonophthalmologic condition. Acute narrow-angle glaucoma is an emergent vision-threatening condition that requires immediate treatment and referral to an ophthalmologist. Although most nonophthalmologic conditions that cause eye pain do not need immediate treatment, giant cell (temporal) arteritis requires urgent treatment with corticosteroids. Other vascular conditions, such as carotid artery disease, thrombosis of the cavernous sinus, and transient ischemic attack or stroke, rarely cause eye pain but must be considered. Pain may also be referred from the sinuses or from neurologic conditions, such as trigeminal neuralgia, migraine and cluster headaches, and increased intracranial pressure. The differential diagnosis of eye pain in the quiet eye is extensive, necessitating a systematic and thorough approach. (Am Fam Physician. 2010;82(1):69-73.

It has been suggested that a Western diet may contribute to the prevalence and manifestation of allergies and asthma through reduced intake of dietary fiber and the subsequent production of their metabolites. Indeed, dietary fiber and its metabolites have been shown to positively influence the development of immune disorders via changes in microbiota composition and the regulation of B- and T-cell activation. However, the effects of these dietary components on the activation of mast cells, key effector cells of the inflammatory response in allergies and asthma, remain poorly characterized. Due to their location in the gut and vascularized tissues, mast cells are exposed to high concentrations of dietary fiber and/or its metabolites. Here, we provide a focused overview of current findings regarding the direct effects of dietary fiber and its various metabolites on the regulation of mast cell activity and the pathophysiology of mast cell-associated diseases.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We examined the relative importance of diastolic (DBP), systolic (SBP) and pulse pressure (PP) as predictors of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in different age groups of Framingham Heart Study participants. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 3060 men and 3479 women between 20 and 79 years of age who were free of CHD and were not on antihypertensive drug therapy at baseline. Cox regression adjusted for age, sex, and other risk factors was used to assess the relations of BP indexes to CHD risk over a 20-year follow-up. In the group {$<$}50 years of age, DBP was the strongest predictor of CHD risk (hazard ratio [HR] per 10 mm Hg increment, 1.34; 95\% CI, 1.18 to 1.51) rather than SBP (HR, 1.14; 95\% CI, 1.06 to 1.24) or PP (HR, 1.02; 95\% CI, 0.89 to 1.17). In the group 50 to 59 years of age, risks were comparable for all 3 BP indexes. In the older age group, the strongest predictor of CHD risk was PP (HR, 1.24; 95\% CI, 1.16 to 1.33). When both SBP and DBP were considered jointly, the former was directly and the latter was inversely related to CHD risk in the oldest age group CONCLUSIONS: With increasing age, there was a gradual shift from DBP to SBP and then to PP as predictors of CHD risk. In patients {$<$}50 years of age, DBP was the strongest predictor. Age 50 to 59 years was a transition period when all 3 BP indexes were comparable predictors, and from 60 years of age on, DBP was negatively related to CHD risk so that PP became superior to SBP.},

The relationship holds even for mild degrees of hyperlipidaemia, a fact that underlines the importance of this category of disorders. Both primary and secondary hyperlipidaemias represent such a variety of abnormalities that an internationally acceptable provisional classification is highly desirable in order to facilitate communication between scientists with different backgrounds., The present memorandum presents such a classification; it briefly describes the criteria for diagnosis of the main types of hyperlipidaemia as well as the methods of their determination. Because lipoproteins offer more information than analysis of plasma lipids (most of the plasma lipids being bound to various proteins), the classification is based on lipoprotein analyses by electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation. Simpler methods, however, such as the observation of plasma and measurements of cholesterol and triglycerides, are used to the fullest possible extent in determining the lipoprotein patterns.},

After 8 wk, most of group 1 achieved a minimum body fat, serum 3,5,3{${'}$}-triiodothyronine (T3) was below normal (78 {$\pm$} 20 ng/dl), testosterone (T) approached castrate levels (4.5 {$\pm$} 3.9 nmol/l), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) declined by one-half (75 {$\pm$} 25 {$\mu$}g/l), and cholesterol rose from 158 {$\pm$} 31 to 217 {$\pm$} 39 mg/dl. Bioavailable T3 and T were further reduced by increases in their specific binding proteins in response to declining insulin. Refeeding, even with continuation of the other stressors, produced prompt recovery of T3, T, and IGF-I. Higher energy intakes in group 2 attenuated the subclinical hypothyroidism and hypercholesterolemia, whereas consistent luteinizing hormone suppression indicated centrally mediated threshold effects on gonadal hormone suppression. We conclude that low T, T3, and IGF-I remained reliable markers of acute energy deficits in the presence of other stressors; elevated cholesterol and cortisol provided information about chronic status, corresponding to diminishing body fat stores.},

It is still unclear which intervention would be most efficacious. Methods and Results Bayesian network meta-analyses were performed to estimate the comparative effectiveness of different interventions for lowering BP. From 60~166 potentially relevant articles, 120 eligible articles (14~923 participants) with a median follow-up of 12~weeks, assessing 22 nonpharmacologic interventions, were included. According to the surface under the cumulative ranking probabilities and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) quality of evidence, for adults with prehypertension to established hypertension, high-quality evidence indicated that the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) was superior to usual care and all other nonpharmacologic interventions in lowering systolic BP (weighted mean difference, 6.97~mm~Hg; 95\% credible interval, 4.50\textendash 9.47) and diastolic BP (weighted mean difference, 3.54~mm~Hg; 95\% credible interval, 1.80\textendash 5.28). Compared with usual care, moderate- to high-quality evidence indicated that aerobic exercise, isometric training, low-sodium and high-potassium salt, comprehensive lifestyle modification, breathing-control, and meditation could lower systolic BP and diastolic BP. For patients with hypertension, moderate- to high-quality evidence suggested that the interventions listed (except comprehensive lifestyle modification) were associated with greater systolic BP and diastolic BP reduction than usual care; salt restriction was also effective in lowering both systolic BP and diastolic BP. Among overweight and obese participants, low-calorie diet and low-calorie diet plus exercise could lower more BP than exercise. Conclusions DASH might be the most effective intervention in lowering BP for adults with prehypertension to established hypertension. Aerobic exercise, isometric training, low-sodium and high-potassium salt, comprehensive lifestyle modification, salt restriction, breathing-control, meditation and low-calorie diet also have obvious effects on BP reduction.},

  abstract = {Background Prehypertension is associated with higher cardiovascular risk, target organ damage, and incidence of hypertension. The Prevention of Hypertension in Patients with PreHypertension (PREVER-Prevention) trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a low-dose diuretic for the prevention of hypertension and end-organ damage. Methods and Results This randomized, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 21 Brazilian academic medical centers. Participants with prehypertension who were aged 30 to 70~years and who did not reach optimal blood pressure after 3~months of lifestyle intervention were randomized to a chlorthalidone/amiloride combination pill or placebo and were evaluated every 3~months during 18~months of treatment. The primary outcome was incidence of hypertension. Development or worsening of microalbuminuria, new-onset diabetes mellitus, and reduction of left ventricular mass were secondary outcomes. Participant characteristics were evenly distributed by trial arms. The incidence of hypertension was significantly lower in 372 study participants allocated to diuretics compared with 358 allocated to placebo (hazard ratio 0.56, 95\% CI 0.38\textendash 0.82), resulting in a cumulative incidence of 11.7\% in the diuretic arm versus 19.5\% in the placebo arm (P=0.004). Adverse events; levels of blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, creatinine, and microalbuminuria; and incidence of diabetes mellitus were no different between the 2 arms. Left ventricular mass assessed through Sokolow-Lyon voltage and voltage-duration product decreased to a greater extent in participants allocated to diuretic therapy compared with placebo (P=0.02). Conclusions A combination of low-dose chlorthalidone and amiloride effectively reduces the risk of incident hypertension and beneficially affects left ventricular mass in patients with prehypertension.

Diagnosis and initiation of effective lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) are recommended as early as possible to prevent ASCVD-related morbidity and mortality. METHODS: The clinical courses of a pair of siblings with an identical hoFH genotype, who exhibited major similarities of their clinical phenotype were analyzed in a case-control fashion including the family. RESULTS: The older sibling was diagnosed with hoFH at the age of 4. Untreated LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) was 17\,mmol/L (660\,mg/dL). LLT including lipoprotein apheresis (LA) was initiated and has been successful for 8\,years now. A reduction of estimated cholesterol burden by 74\% was achieved by LA and combined drug therapy including statins and ezetimibe. The efficacy of escalation of drug therapy was limited because the underlying LDL receptor (LDLR) mutation in the family resulted in substantially reduced receptor function. Treatment with proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9)-antibodies failed. His younger brother died at the age of 2\,years shortly after the hoFH diagnosis of the elder sibling. Postmortem examination revealed advanced aortic root atheroma and aortic valve stenosis. In the older sibling, aortic valve stenosis and insufficiency were treated at the age of 9\,years with mechanical aortic valve replacement. CONCLUSIONS: LLT including LA should be initiated as early as possible following the diagnosis of hoFH with very high LDL-C levels. With the same genotype, the phenotype of hoFH can exhibit similar patterns but outcome is substantially related to treatment.},

Results Greater intakes of total vitamin C were significantly associated with lower serum uric acid concentrations, after adjustment for smoking, BMI, ethnicity, blood pressure, presence of gout, use of aspirin, and intake of energy, alcohol, dairy protein, fructose, meat, seafood, and coffee. An inverse dose-response association was observed through vitamin C intake of 400\textendash 500 mg/d, and then reached a plateau. Adjusted mean uric acid concentrations across total vitamin C intake categories ({$<$}90, 90\textendash 249, 250\textendash 499, 500\textendash 999, or {$\geq$} 1000 mg/d) were 6.4, 6.1, 6.0, 5.7, and 5.7 mg/dl, respectively (P for trend{$<$}0.001). Greater vitamin C intake was associated with lower prevalence of hyperuricemia (serum uric acid {$>$} 6 mg/dl).

When we used dietary data, which were assessed 4\textendash 8 years before blood collection, as predictors, we observed similar inverse associations between vitamin C intake and uric acid.

  abstract = {Background and Objectives In the United States, approximately 60 million Americans suffer from sleep disorders and about 22 million Americans report substance dependence or use disorders annually. Sleep disturbances are common consequences of substance use disorders and are likely found in primary care as well as in specialty practices. The aim of this review was to evaluate the effects of the most frequently used substances\textemdash nicotine, alcohol, opioids, cocaine, caffeine, and cannabis\textemdash have on sleep parameters measured by polysomnography (PSG) and related clinical manifestations. Methods We used electronic databases such as PubMED and PsycINFO to search for relevant articles. We only included studies that assessed sleep disturbances using polysomnography and reviewed the effects of these substances on six clinically relevant sleep parameters: Total sleep time, sleep onset latency, rapid-eye movement, REM latency, wake after sleep onset, and slow wave sleep. Results Our review indicates that these substances have significant impact on sleep and that their effects differ during intoxication, withdrawal, and chronic use. Many of the substance-induced sleep disturbances overlap with those encountered in sleep disorders, medical, and psychiatric conditions. Sleep difficulties also increase the likelihood of substance use disorder relapse, further emphasizing the need for optimizing treatment interventions in these patients. Conclusion and Scientific Significance Our review highlights the importance of systematically screening for substance use in patients with sleep disturbances and highlights the need for further research to understand mechanisms underlying substances-induced sleep disturbances and on effective interventions addressing these conditions.

Progression of disease could lead to acute coronary events, such as acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or sudden cardiac death. However, there are imaging techniques, namely vascular echography and assessment of coronary calcium, capable to make the diagnosis of atherosclerosis at an early stage. There are several studies demonstrating the ability of statins to delay, and in some situation even revert the progression of this condition. Subclinical atherosclerosis is highly prevalent in people with optimal control of the risk factors, and the imaging techniques have been shown to provide an added value over the traditional risk factors: by identifying directly the condition, these techniques allow the reclassification of low-risk to intermediate- or high-risk subjects, thus directing the primary prevention therapeutic strategies, based on high efficacy statins, aimed at delaying or reversing the progression of the disease.},

  abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the influence of estriol administration on the hypothalamus-pituitary function and gonadotropins secretion in patients affected by functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA). Design: Controlled clinical study. Setting: Patients with FHA in a clinical research environment. Patient(s): Twelve hypogonadotropic patients affected by FHA. Intervention(s): Pulsatility study of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) test (10 mg in bolus) at baseline condition and after 8 weeks of therapy with 2 mg/day of estriol. Main Outcome Measure(s): Measurements of plasma LH, FSH, estradiol (E2), androstenedione (A), 17a-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), cortisol, androstenedione (A), testosterone (T), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4), and insulin, and pulse detection. Result(s): After treatment, the FHA patients showed a statistically significant increase of LH plasma levels (from 0.7 \AE{} 0.1 mIU/mL to 3.5 \AE{} 0.3 mIU/mL) and a statistically significant increase of LH pulse amplitude with no changes in LH pulse frequency. In addition, the LH response to the GnRH bolus was a statistically significant increase. Conclusion(s): Estriol administration induced the increase of LH plasma levels in FHA and improved GnRH-induced LH secretion. These findings suggest that estriol administration modulates the neuroendocrine control of the hypothalamus-pituitary unit and induces the recovery of LH synthesis and secretion in hypogonadotropic patients with FHA.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetic lipoprotein disorders have been associated with premature coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS AND RESULTS: The prevalence of such disorders was determined in 102 kindreds (n = 603 subjects) in whom the proband had significant CAD documented by angiography before the age of 60 years. Fasting plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, apolipoprotein (apo) B, and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] values above the 90th percentile and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apo A-I below the 10th percentile of age- and sex-specific norms were defined as abnormal. An abnormality was noted in 73.5\% of probands compared with 38.2\% in age-matched controls (p less than 0.001), with a low HDL cholesterol level (hypoalphalipoproteinemia) being the most common abnormality (39.2\% of cases). In these kindreds, 54\% had a defined phenotypic familial lipoprotein or apolipoprotein disorder. The following frequencies were observed: Lp(a) excess, 18.6\% (includes 12.7\% with no other dyslipidemias); hypertriglyceridemia with hypoalphalipoproteinemia, 14.7\%; combined hyperlipidemia, 13.7\% (11.7\% with and 2.0\% without hypoalphalipoproteinemia); hyperapobetalipoproteinemia (elevated apo B only), 5\%; hypoalphalipoproteinemia, 4\%; hypercholesterolemia (elevated LDL only), 3\%; hypertriglyceridemia, 1\%; decreased apo A-I only, 1\%. Overall, 54\% of the probands had a familial dyslipidemia; unclassifiable lipid disorders (spouse also affected) were found in 3\%. No identifiable familial dyslipidemia was noted in 43\% of kindreds of those; nearly half (45\%) had a sporadic lipid disorder. Parent-offspring and proband-spouse correlations for these biochemical variables revealed that lipoprotein and apolipoprotein levels are in part genetically determined, with Lp(a) showing the highest degree of parent-offspring correlation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that more than half of patients with premature CAD have a familial lipoprotein disorder, with Lp(a) excess, hypertriglyceridemia with hypoalphalipoproteinemia, and combined hyperlipidemia with hypoalphalipoproteinemia being the most common abnormalities.},

Each of these four manipulations was followed by a day-time sleep beginning at 1100 hr. No significant changes in the duration of the first sleep cycle appeared. As the prior sleep loss increased both SWE (slow-wave energy; accumulated EEG delta power density) and SW A (slow-wave activity; EEG delta power per minute) increased during the IlOO-hr sleeps. This was observed for the entire cycles, the nonrapid eye movement (NREM) periods, and the SWS periods, respectively. SWS latency decreased and SWS duration increased, respectively, markedly with prior waking. Also, for the progressively postponed sleeps (started at 2300 hr, 0300 hr, 0500 hr and 1100 hr) there were changes, but not as clear. After 28 hr of continuous waking there was a marked increase ofSWA during SWS. Also, at this level there was a spill over of SW A to the second cycle. It is suggested that there might be a limit to the amount and intensity of SWS that can be accommodated in the first sleep cycle and that this limit is reached before the appearance of REM sleep.},

To date, there is only scarce data evaluating nutrition among CrossFit training and they mostly focus on selected nutritional interventions.

The study consisted of 62 CrossFit athletes (31 men and 31 women, aged 31.0 {$\pm$} 5.2 and 30.0 {$\pm$} 4.3 years, respectively). Body composition was analyzed by electrical bioimpedance. Dietary intake was assessed using a standardized 3-day food record. Body fat percentage for females and males was 20.3 {$\pm$} 4.3\% and 13.7 {$\pm$} 3.3\% respectively. The energy intake in the diet was lower (\textasciitilde 1700 kcal in women and \textasciitilde 2300 kcal in men) than the recommended demand. Moreover, low consumption of carbohydrates was stated, as well as an inadequate intake of folate, vitamin E (in women), and minerals, such as Fe and Ca (in women). The energy, carbohydrate, iron, and calcium intake in the CrossFit participants' diet was too low in comparison to recommendations. It seems justified to educate athletes and coaches about nutritional habits, and individual energy and nutrients requirements.},

FH is among the most commonly occurring congenital metabolic disorders. FH is a treatable disease. Aggressive lipid lowering is necessary to achieve the target LDL cholesterol reduction of at least 50\% or more. Even greater target LDL cholesterol reductions may be necessary for FH patients who have other CHD risk factors. Despite the prevalence of this disease and the availability of effective treatment options, FH is both underdiagnosed and undertreated, particularly among children. Deficiencies in the diagnosis and treatment of FH indicate the need for greatly increased awareness and understanding of this disease, both on the part of the public and of healthcare practitioners. This document provides recommendations for the screening, diagnosis and treatment of FH in pediatric and adult patients developed by the National Lipid Association Expert Panel on Familial Hypercholesterolemia. This report goes beyond previously published guidelines by providing specific clinical guidance for the primary care clinician and lipid specialist with the goal of improving care of patients with FH and reducing their elevated risk for CHD.},

  abstract = {Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is the most abundant and the most atherogenic class of cholesterol-carrying lipoproteins in human plasma. The level of plasma LDL is regulated by the LDL receptor, a cell surface glycoprotein that removes LDL from plasma by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Defects in the gene encoding the LDL receptor, which occur in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, elevate the plasma LDL level and produce premature coronary atherosclerosis. The physiologically important LDL receptors are located primarily in the liver, where their number is regulated by the cholesterol content of the hepatocyte. When the cholesterol content of hepatocytes is raised by ingestion of diets high in saturated fat and cholesterol, LDL receptors fall and plasma LDL levels rise. Conversely, maneuvers that lower the cholesterol content of hepatocytes, such as ingestion of drugs that inhibit cholesterol synthesis (mevinolin or compactin) or prevent the reutilization of bile acids (cholestyramine or colestipol), stimulate LDL receptor production and lower plasma LDL levels. The normal process of receptor regulation can therefore be exploited in powerful and novel ways so as to reverse hypercholesterolemia and prevent atherosclerosis.},

The development of pharmacological interventions aimed at delaying or preventing the onset of chronic conditions and other age-related diseases has been at the forefront of the aging field. Preclinical findings have demonstrated that species, sex and strain confer significant heterogeneity on reaching the desired health- and lifespan-promoting pharmacological responses in model organisms. Translating the safety and efficacy of these interventions to humans and the lack of reliable biomarkers that serve as predictors of health outcomes remain a challenge. Here, we will survey current pharmacological interventions that promote lifespan extension and/or increased healthspan in animals and humans, and review the various anti-aging interventions selected for inclusion in the NIA's Interventions Testing Program as well as the ClinicalTrials.gov database that target aging or age-related diseases in humans.},

The patients received [14C]cholesterol intravenously, and the resulting specific activity-time curves (for 40 and 30 weeks, respectively) were fitted with a three-pool model. Parameters were compared with those from studies of cholesterol turnover in 82 normal and hyperlipidemic subjects. A three-pool model gave the best fit for the abetalipoproteinemic patients, as well as for the 82 previously studied subjects, suggesting general applicability of this model. Cholesterol production rates in the two abetalipoproteinemic subjects (0.82 and 0.89 g/day) were close to values predicted for persons of their body weight. Thus, total body turnover rate of cholesterol was quite normal in abetalipoproteinemia, confirming previous reports. Very low values (9.2 and 8.4 g) were found for M1, the size of the rapidly exchanging compartment pool 1, in the two abetalipoproteinemic subjects. These values were well below the values predicted (from the comparison study population) for normal persons of this size with low plasma cholesterol levels. For one patient, total body exchangeable cholesterol was very low, although not significantly below the predicted values for a person of his size. In the second patient, the observed estimate for total body exchangeable cholesterol was well within the range of values predicted for persons of her size with low to extremely low cholesterol levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

This study examined the effects of obesity on lipid and CHO oxidation during exercise. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Seven obese and seven lean [body mass index (BMI), 33 +/- 0.8 and 23.7 +/- 1.2 kg/m(2), respectively] sedentary, middle-aged men matched for aerobic capacity performed 60 minutes of cycle exercise at similar relative (50\% VO(2max)) and absolute exercise intensities. RESULTS: Obese men derived a greater proportion of their energy from fatty-acid oxidation than lean men (43 +/- 5\% 31 +/- 2\%; p = 0.02). Plasma fatty-acid oxidation determined from recovery of infused [0.15 micromol/kg fat-free mass (FFM) per minute] [1-(13)C]-palmitate in breath CO(2) was similar for obese and lean men (8.4 +/- 1.1 and 29 +/- 15 micromol/kg FFM per minute). Nonplasma fatty-acid oxidation, presumably, from intramuscular sources, was 50\% higher in obese men than in lean men (10.0 +/- 0.6 versus 6.6 +/- 0.8 micromol/kg FFM per minute; p {$<$} 0.05). Systemic glucose disposal was similar in lean and obese groups (33 +/- 8 and 29 +/- 15 micromol/kg FFM per minute). However, the estimated rate of glycogen-oxidation was 50\% lower in obese than in lean men (61 +/- 12 versus 90 +/- 6 micromol/kg FFM per minute; p {$<$} 0.05). DISCUSSION: During moderate exercise, obese sedentary men have increased rates of fatty-acid oxidation from nonplasma sources and reduced rates of CHO oxidation, particularly muscle glycogen, compared with lean sedentary men.},

This guideline was funded by the Endocrine Society. Objective: To formulate clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA). Participants: The participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed task force of eight experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. Evidence: This evidence-based guidelinewas developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The task force commissioned two systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies. Consensus Process: One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Endocrine Society committees and members and cosponsoring organizations reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of this guideline. Conclusions: FHA is a form of chronic anovulation, not due to identifiable organic causes, but often associated with stress, weight loss, excessive exercise, or a combination thereof. Investigations should include assessment of systemic and endocrinologic etiologies, as FHA is a diagnosis of exclusion. A multidisciplinary treatment approach is necessary, including medical, dietary, and mental health support. Medical complications include, among others, bone loss and infertility, and appropriate therapies are under debate and investigation. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 102: 1413-1439, 2017).},

  abstract = {Lipoprotein lipid physiology in pregnancy has important implications for the developing fetus and newborn as well as the mother. Cholesterol is essential for normal fetal development. It is key in the formation of cell membranes. In pregnancy, multiple physiological changes occur that contribute to the alterations in lipid profiles of healthy, gestating women. Initially, there is an anabolic phase with an increase in lipid synthesis and fat storage in preparation for the increases in fetal energy needs in late pregnancy. During the third trimester, lipid physiology transitions to a net catabolic phase with a breakdown of fat deposits. The catabolism increases substrates for the growing fetus. Overall, the changes in lipid physiology throughout the course of pregnancy allow for proper nutrients for the fetus and they reflect increasing insulin resistance in the mother. Our understanding and appreciation of the full scope and implications of dyslipidemia in pregnancy on both maternal and fetal outcomes is not complete; however, it is well known that dyslipidemia in pregnancy is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes affecting both maternal and fetal health. There are direct implications of dyslipidemia on perinatal outcomes as well as intricate relationships between dyslipidemia and other comorbid intrauterine conditions. There is also developing research indicating that the in utero environment influences susceptibility to chronic diseases later in life, a concept known as ``developmental programming.'' Given all of these implications of dyslipidemia in pregnancy on maternal and fetal health, it is prudent to screen women for lipid disorders. The ideal time for this is before conception; if a woman has not been screening before pregnancy, the initial obstetrical visit is ideal. Abnormal lipids should be followed through pregnancy. The treatment of dyslipidemia in pregnancy is multifactorial, including diet, exercise and weight management. Medical management is complicated by FDA classifications for medication risks to the fetus, however some evidence indicates there may be permissible pharmacological treatments for dyslipidemia in pregnancy.},

In the present study we have examined the net effects of this interplay in one normal and five hypercholesteremic subjects when various amounts of cholesterol were made available for absorption. Feeding large amounts of cholesterol to the normocholesteremic patient caused an expansion of body pools by as much as 20 g before the amount of cholesterol re-excreted as fecal neutral steroids each day came into balance with the cholesterol absorbed from the diet. There was no detectable decrease in total body synthesis of cholesterol nor any increase in conversion of cholesterol into bile acids. However, feedback control of cholesterol synthesis was demonstrable when large quantities of plant sterols were fed: in the hypercholesteremic patients thus studied, the absorption of both endogenous and exogenous cholesterol was then greatly reduced, and a compensatory increase in synthesis occurred. Thus, the plant sterol experiments, but not the cholesterol feeding experiment, demonstrated that feedback control by dietary cholesterol does occur in man. That feedback control by dietary cholesterol is relatively unimportant in man seems to be due to the fact that in the metabolic ``steady state'' the absorption mechanism is essentially saturated by the large amounts of endogenous cholesterol available for reabsorption. These findings demonstrate that there are important differences between man and various laboratory animals in regard to the interaction of absorption and synthesis as factors controlling the size of tissue pools of cholesterol.},

Estimates of daily synthesis by this method are based on the premise that the subject is in the metabolic steady state; Le., the synthesis of cholesterol is equal to the balance (or difference) between the intake of cholesterol and the excretion of cholesterol and its products. To test this premise, we carried out sterol balances in 11 patients; simultaneously, after administration of isotopic cholesterol, turnover was calculated according to previously described models (one-pool, two-pool, or isotopic steady state models for the distribution of radioactive cholesterol within various pools of the body). With calculations based on the one-pool model, turnover rates were considerably higher than estimates based on all other models, and reasons are given for considering these to be overestimates. Good agreement was obtained between results calculated from the two-pool model and those based on sterol balance data ; neither method is theoretically preferable to the other. However, with the sterol balance method supplemented by isotopic techniques, valid measurements of cholesterol absorption can be obtained; this in turn permits the essential distinction to be made between daily synthesis and daily turnover of cholesterol when the diet contains cholesterol.},

Moreover, vaccines based on viral-encoded peptides may not be effective against future coronavirus epidemics, as virus mutations could make them futile. Indeed, new Influenza virus strains emerge every year, requiring new immunizations. A tentative suggestion based on existing therapeutics, which would likely be resistant to new coronavirus mutations, is to use available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the aggressiveness and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 virus infections. This idea is based on observations that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) very likely serves as the binding site for SARS-CoV-2, the strain implicated in the current COVID-19 epidemic, similarly to strain SARS-CoV implicated in the 2002?2003 SARS epidemic. This commentary elaborates on the idea of considering AT1R blockers as tentative treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and proposes a research direction based on datamining of clinical patient records for assessing its feasibility.},

The Coronary Drug Project (CDP) was the largest of these trials and the only one to use niacin monotherapy affecting cardiovascular outcomes: recurrent myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular events were significantly decreased. After long-term (15 years) follow-up, total mortality was also found to be decreased. The other 5 trials used varying combinations of niacin with other pharmacologic agents, examining coronary and total mortality, coronary events, and angiographic progression/regression. Significant benefit was found in all trials except for one in patients with normal cholesterol levels at entry. Thus, the use of niacin to prevent or treat atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is based on strong and consistent evidence from clinical trials.},

  abstract = {There is a current need for a therapy that can alleviate the social and economic burden that presents itself with debilitating and recurring musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries and disorders. Currently, several therapies are emerging and undergoing trials in animal models; these focus on the manipulation and administration of several growth factors implicated with healing. However, limitations include in vivo instability, reliance on biocompatible and robust carriers and restricted application procedures (local and direct). The aim of this paper is therefore to critically review the current literature surrounding the use of BPC 157, as a feasible therapy for healing and functional restoration of soft tissue damage, with a focus on tendon, ligament and skeletal muscle healing. Currently, all studies investigating BPC 157 have demonstrated consistently positive and prompt healing effects for various injury types, both traumatic and systemic and for a plethora of soft tissues. However, to date, the majority of studies have been performed on small rodent models and the efficacy of BPC 157 is yet to be confirmed in humans. Further, over the past two decades, only a handful of research groups have performed in-depth studies regarding this peptide. Despite this, it is apparent that BPC 157 has huge potential and following further development has promise as a therapy to conservatively treat or aid recovery in hypovascular and hypocellular soft tissues such as tendon and ligaments. Moreover, skeletal muscle injury models have suggested a beneficial effect not only for disturbances that occur as a result of direct trauma but also for systemic insults including hyperkalamia and hypermagnesia. Promisingly, there are few studies reporting any adverse reactions to the administration of BPC 157, although there is still a need to understand the precise healing mechanisms for this therapy to achieve clinical realisation.},

The dentist should develop a basic action plan that is understood by all staff members. The goal is to manage the patient's care until he or she recovers fully or until help arrives. The most important aspect of almost all medical emergencies in dentistry is to prevent or correct insufficient oxygenation of the brain or heart. The dentist or a staff member needs to position (P) the patient appropriately. He or she then needs to assess and, if needed, manage the airway (A), breathing (B) and circulation (C). The dentist and staff members then can consider ``D,'' which stands for definitive treatment, differential diagnosis, drugs or defibrillation.},

Although endocrine balance and an optimal body composition are essential for top elite performance, these parameters have not yet been explored fully in Olympic sportswomen. The objective of this study, therefore, was to characterize the menstrual status, body composition, and endocrine balance in female Olympic athletes participating in different disciplines.         Methods:~         Ninety Swedish female Olympic athletes underwent a gynecologic examination that included vaginal examination by ultrasound and determination of body composition. In addition, blood samples were collected for the analysis of reproductive hormones and biomarkers of energy availability.         Results:~         Of all the athletes, 47\% were using hormonal contraception (HC). Menstrual dysfunction (MD) was common (27\%) among those not using HC and, particularly, in endurance athletes. However, the proportion of body fat and biomarkers of energy availability were within the normal ranges and none exhibited osteopenia. On the contrary, bone mineral density was generally high, particularly in the power athletes. The most common diagnosis associated with MD was polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and not hypothalamic inhibition because of energy deficiency.         Conclusions:~         Female Olympic athletes participating in different sports were found to have an anabolic body composition and biomarkers of energy availability within the normal ranges. Most cases of menstrual disturbances observed were due to PCOS. These findings challenge the contemporary concept that reproductive dysfunction in sportswomen is typically a consequence of chronic energy deficiency.},

However, patients with T2D show lower physical activity and reduced cardiorespiratory fitness than healthy individuals. It would be ideal for clinicians to co-prescribe glucose-lowering agents that improve cardiorespiratory fitness or exercise capacity in conjunction with exercise therapy. Metformin does not improve cardiorespiratory fitness and may attenuate any beneficial effect of exercise in patients with T2D. In contrast, thiazolidinediones appear to improve cardiorespiratory fitness in patients with T2D. Although evidence is limited, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors may improve cardiorespiratory fitness in patients with heart failure, and the effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists on cardiorespiratory fitness is controversial. Recent clinical trials have shown that both SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists exert a favorable effect on cardiovascular disease. It becomes more important to choose drugs that have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system beyond glucose-lowering effects. Further studies are warranted to determine an ideal glucose-lowering agent combined with exercise therapy for the treatment of T2D.},

Patients were retrospectively eligible for inclusion if they were 18 years and older and had an inpatient or outpatient colonoscopy procedure code in any facility within the Geisinger Health System during the period from January 1, 2002 to August 25, 2010. Data are presented as median and inter-quartile range, for continuous variables, and as frequency and percentage for categorical variables. Baseline comparisons across those with and without a perforation were made using the two-sample t-test and Pearson's {$\chi$}2 test, as appropriate., RESULTS: A total of 50 perforations were diagnosed out of 80118 colonoscopies, which corresponded to an incidence of 0.06\% (95\%CI: 0.05-0.08) or a rate of 6.2 per 10000 colonoscopies. All possible risk factors associated with colonic perforation with a P-value {$<$} 0.1 were checked for inclusion in a multivariable log-binomial regression model predicting 7-d colonic perforation. The final model resulted in the following risk factors which were significantly associated with risk of colonic perforation: age, gender, body mass index, albumin level, intensive care unit (ICU) patients, inpatient setting, and abdominal pain and Crohn's disease as indications for colonoscopy., CONCLUSION: The cumulative 7 d incidence of colonic perforation in this cohort was 0.06\%. Advanced age and female gender were significantly more likely to have perforation. Increasing albumin and BMI resulted in decreased risk of colonic perforation. Having a colonoscopy indication of abdominal pain or Crohn's disease resulted in a higher risk of colonic perforation. Colonoscopies performed in inpatients and particularly the ICU setting had substantially greater odds of perforation. Biopsy and polypectomy did not increase the risk of perforation and only three perforations occurred with screening colonoscopy.},

We tested the hypothesis that sex differences may influence coronary atherosclerotic burden and coronary endothelial function before development of obstructive CAD. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 142 patients (53 men, 89 women; mean +/- SD age, 49.3 +/- 11.7 years) with early CAD simultaneously underwent intravascular ultrasonography and coronary endothelial function assessment. Atheroma burden in the left main and proximal left anterior descending (LAD) arteries was significantly greater in men than women (median, 23.0\% vs. 14.1\%, P = 0.002; median, 40.1\% vs. 29.3\%, P = 0.001, respectively). Atheroma eccentricity in the proximal LAD artery was significantly higher in men than women (median, 0.89 vs. 0.80, P = 0.04). The length of the coronary segments with endothelial dysfunction was significantly longer in men than women (median, 39.2 vs. 11.1 mm, P = 0.002). In contrast, maximal coronary flow reserve was significantly lower in women than men (2.80 vs. 3.30, P {$<$} 0.001). Sex was an independent predictor of atheroma burden in the left main and proximal LAD arteries (both P {$<$} 0.05) by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Men have greater atheroma burden, more eccentric atheroma, and more diffuse epicardial endothelial dysfunction than women. These results suggest that men have more severe structural and functional abnormalities in epicardial coronary arteries than women, even in patients with early atherosclerosis, which may result in the higher incidence rates of CAD and ST-segment myocardial infarction in men than women.},

We examined clinical features of migraine with aura in a large group of patients enrolled in a clinical trial, and compared retrospective migraine attack characteristics reported upon enrollment in the trial with those recorded prospectively in the trial.MethodsPatients with migraine (n?=?267) with typical visual aura in more than 30\% of their attacks were enrolled from 16 centers for a clinical trial. Upon enrollment, patients provided a detailed retrospective description of the clinical features of their attacks of migraine. During the trial, clinical symptoms in migraine attacks starting with aura were recorded prospectively in 861 attacks.ResultsRetrospectively reported visual aura symptoms were variable and often overlapping; the most common symptoms were dots or flashing lights, wavy or jagged lines, blind spots, and tunnel vision. Multiple patients reported more than one visual phenomenon. Approximately half of the patients reported nonvisual aura symptoms, the most common were numbness and tingling, followed by difficulty in recalling or speaking words. A significant percentage of patients also reported a change in olfaction. There were several inconsistencies between the features of prospectively recorded and retrospectively reported attacks. Headache, nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were all less common in prospectively recorded attacks as compared with retrospective reporting. Nausea was prospectively recorded in only 51\% of attacks and mostly with mild intensity. The occurrence and severity of nausea was reduced with advancing patient age. Phonophobia was not consistently recorded in conjunction with photophobia.ConclusionThese findings are consistent with variable involvement of different brain regions during a migraine attack. The variable occurrence of nausea, and phonophobia in conjunction with photophobia, both defining features of migraine, may be an important consideration in designing clinical studies of migraine in which prospectively recorded attacks are diagnosed based on these clinical features.},

Inadequate reduction of their blood pressure is a likely cause, but the optimum target blood pressure is not known. The impact of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) has never been investigated in patients with hypertension. We aimed to assess the optimum target diastolic blood pressure and the potential benefit of a low dose of acetylsalicylic acid in the treatment of hypertension. METHODS: 18790 patients, from 26 countries, aged 50-80 years (mean 61.5 years) with hypertension and diastolic blood pressure between 100 mm Hg and 115 mm Hg (mean 105 mm Hg) were randomly assigned a target diastolic blood pressure. 6264 patients were allocated to the target pressure {$<$} or =90 mm Hg, 6264 to {$<$} or =85 mm Hg, and 6262 to {$<$} or =80 mm Hg. Felodipine was given as baseline therapy with the addition of other agents, according to a five-step regimen. In addition, 9399 patients were randomly assigned 75 mg/day acetylsalicylic acid (Bamycor, Astra) and 9391 patients were assigned placebo. FINDINGS: Diastolic blood pressure was reduced by 20.3 mm Hg, 22.3 mm Hg, and 24.3 mm Hg, in the {$<$} or =90 mm Hg, {$<$} or =85 mm Hg, and {$<$} or =80 mm Hg target groups, respectively. The lowest incidence of major cardiovascular events occurred at a mean achieved diastolic blood pressure of 82.6 mm Hg; the lowest risk of cardiovascular mortality occurred at 86.5 mm Hg. Further reduction below these blood pressures was safe. In patients with diabetes mellitus there was a 51\% reduction in major cardiovascular events in target group {$<$} or =80 mm Hg compared with target group {$<$} or =90 mm Hg (p for trend=0.005). Acetylsalicylic acid reduced major cardiovascular events by 15\% (p=0.03) and all myocardial infarction by 36\% (p=0.002), with no effect on stroke. There were seven fatal bleeds in the acetylsalicylic acid group and eight in the placebo group, and 129 versus 70 non-fatal major bleeds in the two groups, respectively (p{$<$}0.001). INTERPRETATION: Intensive lowering of blood pressure in patients with hypertension was associated with a low rate of cardiovascular events. The HOT Study shows the benefits of lowering the diastolic blood pressure down to 82.6 mm Hg. Acetylsalicylic acid significantly reduced major cardiovascular events with the greatest benefit seen in all myocardial infarction. There was no effect on the incidence of stroke or fatal bleeds, but non-fatal major bleeds were twice as common.},

  abstract = {The Eyring's rate process theory and free volume concept, two very popular theories in chemistry and physics fields, are employed to treat infectious disease transmissions. The susceptible individuals are assumed to move stochastically from one place to another. The virus particle transmission rate is assumed to obey the Eyring's rate process theory and also controlled by how much free volume available in a system. The transmission process is considered to be a sequential chemical reaction, and the concentrations or fractions of four epidemiological compartments, the susceptible, the exposed, the infected, and the removed, can be derived and calculated. The obtained equations show that the basic reproduction number, R0, is not a constant, dependent on the volume fraction of virus particles, virus particle size, and virus particle packing structure, the energy barrier associated with susceptible individuals, and environment temperature. The developed models are applied to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) transmission and make predictions on peak time, peak infected, and R0. Our work provides a simple and straightforward approach to estimate how infection diseases evolve and how many people may be infected.},

Harada-Shiba et al, J Jpn Atheroscler Soc 1991; 19:227-242). The LDL receptor activities in the cultured fibroblasts of the patients were compared with those of FH heterozygotes and homozygotes for the LDL receptor mutation. The LDL receptor activities in the cultured fibroblasts of the patients were in the normal range, but their plasma cholesterol concentrations were similar to patients with homozygous FH. After the plasma LDL was removed by plasmapheresis in both patients, plasma cholesterol levels started to increase. The "rebound" of plasma cholesterol was compared with those for heterozygous and homozygous FH. The plasma cholesterol levels of the patients, which were greater than 410 mg/dl 2 weeks after plasmapheresis, were much higher than those of FH heterozygotes (232-311 mg/dl) but similar to those of FH homozygotes (345-464 mg/dl). The urinary mevalonate excretion rate, which reflects the rate of whole-body cholesterol synthesis, was higher for the brother (patient 1, 32.6 nmol/kg.day-1) than for the normal subjects (17.7 +/- 4.1 nmol/kg.day-1) but was similar to those of FH homozygotes (31.2 +/- 4.3 nmol/kg.day-1) and heterozygotes (29.8 +/- 10.9 nmol/kg.day-1). To estimate the catabolic and production rates of cholesterol in the brother, the time course for the increment in the total cholesterol level after plasmapheresis was analyzed by the two-compartment model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Oral sulfinpyrazone (250 mumol/kg body weight per day in three divided doses) in eight chronically homocystinemic baboons (0.14 +/- 0.04 mM plasma homocystine) decreased the extent of aortic endothelial injury as measured morphometrically by silver staining techniques, compared with six untreated comparably homocystinemic animals (denuded surface averaged 0.5\% with range 0-2.1 vs 7.7 +/- 1.6\%, respectively; P less than 0.001). Sulfinpyrazone therapy to homocystinemic baboons also normalized platelet survival and turnover measurements (5.1 +/- 0.4 days and 70,000 +/- 11,000 platelets/microliter per day vs. 2.8 +/- 0.6 days and 179,000 +/- 19,000 platelets/microliter per day in untreated homocystinemic controls; P less than 0.001). Sulfinpyrazone therapy also reduced the size and frequency of homocysteine-induced intimal lesion formation (P less than 0.001). Although sulfinpyrazone reduced the amount of specific 51Cr release from cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells induced by 10 mM homocysteine after 24 hours of co-incubation, no effect was observed in assays of endothelial cell detachment when sulfinpyrazone (10(-5) M) or its thioether metabolite were pre- or co-incubated during 24 hours with homocysteine (2.5-10 mM). These data suggest that sulfinpyrazone may protect endothelial cells from injury in vivo by some apparently indirect mechanism.},

We and others have shown previously that mitochondrial uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) improves functional recovery of the rodent heart during reperfusion. Here, we demonstrate that pharmacological induction of hyperinsulinemia in mice down-regulates myocardial UCP3. Decreased UCP3 expression was linked to the development of selective insulin resistance in the heart, characterized by decreased basal activity of Akt but preserved activity of the p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and overactivation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1-mediated lipogenic program. In cultured myocytes, insulin treatment and SREBP-1 overexpression decreased, whereas SREBP-1 interference increased, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-stimulated expression of UCP3. Promoter deletion and site-directed mutagenesis identified three functional sterol regulatory elements in the vicinity of a known complex intronic enhancer. Increased binding of SREBP-1 to this DNA region was confirmed in the heart of hyperinsulinemic mice. In conclusion, we describe a hitherto unknown regulatory mechanism by which insulin inhibits cardiac UCP3 expression through activation of the lipogenic factor SREBP-1. Sustained down-regulation of cardiac UCP3 by hyperinsulinemia may partly explain the poor prognosis of type 2 diabetic patients after myocardial infarction.},

Recent advances have shown that increased plasma Hcy is also a fundamental cause of neurodegenerative diseases (including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and dementia), diabetes, Down syndrome, and megaloblastic anemia, among others. In recent years, increased plasma homocysteine has also been shown to be closely related to cancer. In this review, we discuss the relation between elevated plasma Hcy levels and cancer, and we conclude that disturbed homocysteine metabolism is associated with cancer.

  abstract = {Background: Thyroid nodules are a common clinical problem, and differentiated thyroid cancer is becoming increasingly prevalent. Since the American Thyroid Association's (ATA's) guidelines for the management of these disorders were revised in 2009, significant scientific advances have occurred in the field. The aim of these guidelines is to inform clinicians, patients, researchers, and health policy makers on published evidence relating to the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer. Methods: The specific clinical questions addressed in these guidelines were based on prior versions of the guidelines, stakeholder input, and input of task force members. Task force panel members were educated on knowledge synthesis methods, including electronic database searching, review and selection of relevant citations, and critical appraisal of selected studies. Published English language articles on adults were eligible for inclusion. The American College of Physicians Guideline Grading System was used for critical appraisal of evidence and grading strength of recommendations for therapeutic interventions. We developed a similarly formatted system to appraise the quality of such studies and resultant recommendations. The guideline panel had complete editorial independence from the ATA. Competing interests of guideline task force members were regularly updated, managed, and communicated to the ATA and task force members. Results: The revised guidelines for the management of thyroid nodules include recommendations regarding initial evaluation, clinical and ultrasound criteria for fine-needle aspiration biopsy, interpretation of fine-needle aspiration biopsy results, use of molecular markers, and management of benign thyroid nodules. Recommendations regarding the initial management of thyroid cancer include those relating to screening for thyroid cancer, staging and risk assessment, surgical management, radioiodine remnant ablation and therapy, and thyrotropin suppression therapy using levothyroxine. Recommendations related to long-term management of differentiated thyroid cancer include those related to surveillance for recurrent disease using imaging and serum thyroglobulin, thyroid hormone therapy, management of recurrent and metastatic disease, consideration for clinical trials and targeted therapy, as well as directions for future research. Conclusions: We have developed evidence-based recommendations to inform clinical decision-making in the management of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer. They represent, in our opinion, contemporary optimal care for patients with these disorders.},

Inclusion of ECG measurements, coupled with heart rate variability analysis, added a demonstration of the contribution made by the autonomic nervous system under these conditions. We clearly demonstrate that the cardiac work, estimated as rate-pressure product, necessary to undertake the transition from supine to standing, is fixed for a given group of subjects. However, the individual contribution of heart rate and systolic pressure to the cardiac workload is subject to the external factors of gravity and caffeine. Such an activity also demonstrates additional benefits, including unstructured teaching opportunities to augment classroom learning associated with integrative physiology and also the discussion of ethical issues with regard to human experimentation.},

Twenty-three patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease participated in a prospective 6-week trial at the Christiana Care Medical Center in Newark, Del, between August 2000 and September 2001. All patients were obese (mean +/- SD body mass index [BMI], 39.0+/-7.3 kg/m2) and had been treated with statins before entry in the trial. Fifteen obese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (BMI, 36.1+/-9.7 kg/m2) and 8 obese patients with reactive hypoglycemia (BMI, 46.8+/-10 kg/m2) were monitored during an HSF-SA diet for 24 and 52 weeks, respectively, between 1997 and 2000. In patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, mean +/- SD total body weight (TBW) decreased 5.2\%+/-2.5\% (P{$<$}.001) as did body fat percentage (P=.02). Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analysis of lipids showed decreases in total triglycerides (P{$<$}.001), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides (P{$<$}.001), VLDL size (P{$<$}.001), large VLDL concentration (P{$<$}.001), and medium VLDL concentration (P{$<$}.001). High-density lipoprotein (HDL) and LDL concentrations were unchanged, but HDL size (P=.01) and LDL size (P=.02) increased.

The identified variant, adjacent to the tumor suppressor genes CDKN2A and CDKN2B, was associated with the disease with high significance. Approximately 21\% of individuals in the population are homozygous for this variant, and their estimated risk of suffering myocardial infarction is 1.64 times as great as that of noncarriers.

Acute ingestion of caffeine usually increases cardiac work; however, caffeine impairs the expected proportional increase in myocardial blood flow to match this increased work of the heart, most notably during exercise. This appears to be mainly due to caffeine's effect on blocking adenosine-induced vasodilatation in the coronary arteries in normal healthy subjects. This review summarizes the available medical literature specifically relating to pure caffeine tablet ingestion and reduced exercise coronary blood flow, and suggests possible mechanisms. Further studies are needed to evaluate this effect for other common caffeine-delivery systems, including coffee, energy beverages, and energy gels, which are often used for exercise performance enhancement, especially in teenagers and young athletes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Four 1-hour repeated measurements (two measurements for bedroom the others for car) of particles with a size range of 20\textendash 1000~nm measured by number concentrations (NC0.02\textendash 1), temperature and relatively humidity, and cough/sneeze counts per hour were conducted for each volunteer.

  abstract = {Small fiber neuropathy manifests in a variety of different diseases and often results in symptoms of burning pain, shooting pain, allodynia, and hyperesthesia. Diagnosis of small fiber neuropathy is determined primarily by the history and physical exam, but functional neurophysiologic testing and skin biopsy evaluation of intraepidermal nerve fiber density can provide diagnostic confirmation. Management of small fiber neuropathy depends on the underlying etiology with concurrent treatment of associated neuropathic pain. A variety of recent guidelines propose the use of antidepressants, anticonvulsants, opioids, topical therapies, and nonpharmacologic treatments as part of the overall management of neuropathic pain. Unfortunately, little data about the treatment of pain specifically in small fiber neuropathy exist because most studies combine mixed neuropathic pain syndromes in the analysis. Additional studies targeting the treatment of pain in small fiber neuropathy are needed to guide decision making.},

  abstract = {Small-fiber sensory neuropathy with neuropathic pain had been a diagnostic challenge for neurologists. We and several groups have developed skin biopsy with quantitation of intraepidermal nerve fiber (IENF) density as a diagnostic approach. In the skin with small-fiber sensory neuropathy, there are pathological hallmarks: reduced IENF density with degeneration of subepidermal nerve plexuses and dermal nerves. Skin denervation is a major presentation of diabetic neuropathy and inflammatory neuropathies including Guillain-Barr? syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. The skin biopsy approach also provides an opportunity to examine dermal vasculature and inflammatory vasculopathy is demonstrated in vasculitic neuropathy, systemic lupus erythematosus, and eosinophilia-associated neuropathy. In addition to neuropahtologic evidence, the functional consequences of cutaneous nerve degeneration can be assessed with quantitative sensory testing (QST), contact heat evoked potential (CHEP), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). One major etiology of small-fiber sensory neuropathy is familial amyloid polyneuropathy caused by mutations of transthyretin (TTR). We recently conducted studies on a large cohort of unique TTR mutation on Ala97Ser in Taiwan. These patients had significant skin denervation in addition to motor and autonomic neuropathy. Taken together, the skin biopsy with quantitation of IENF density provides diagnostic utility for small-fiber sensory neuropathy and the combination of psychophysical, physiological, and neuroimaging examinations offer comprehensive assessments for patients with neuropathic pain due o cutaneous nerve degeneration.},

  abstract = {Background: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which originated in Wuhan, China, and spreading over the country including Jiangsu Province. Our study aimed to study the epidemiological, clinical characteristics and therapies of these severe cases in Jiangsu Province.Methods: Patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who were admitted to 12 first-tier hospitals in Jiangsu Province between Jan 24 and Feb 23, 2020 were retrospective enrolled. All diagnosis were confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Clinical characteristics and prognosis of 60 cases with COVID-19 were compared and analysis.Findings: A total of 631 infected cases with COVID-19 in Jiangsu Province, 60 of which were severe cases. Up until Feb 23, 2020, the mortality rate of these severe patients was 0\%. The median age was 57 years (range, 26 to 97), and 58 {$\cdot$} 3\% were man. The body mass index (BMI) of these patients was higher, with an average of 25 kg/m2.  51 {$\cdot$} 7\% of cases had at least one comorbidity. Mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score on admission was 14{$\pm$}5. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) appeared in 15\% of the patients. White blood cell counts decreased in 45 {$\cdot$} 0\% of patients, lymphopenia in 63 {$\cdot$} 3\%, thrombocytopenia in 13 {$\cdot$} 3\%, and procalcitonin levels in 88 {$\cdot$} 3\% of the patients were less than 0 {$\cdot$} 5 ng/mL. There were no statistically significant differences in immunoglobulin therapy and glucocorticoids therapy between the improvement and deterioration subgroups ( P {$>$}0 {$\cdot$} 05). Logistic regression analysis showed higher levels of troponin T (odds ratio [OR]: 1 {$\cdot$} 04; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1 {$\cdot$} 00-1 {$\cdot$} 08; P =0 {$\cdot$} 04), antiviral therapy with interferon (OR: 6 {$\cdot$} 33; 95\% CI: 1 {$\cdot$} 18-33  䟞 P =0 {$\cdot$} 03), and the application of non-invasive mechanical ventilation (OR: 1 {$\cdot$} 99; 95\%CI: 1 {$\cdot$} 17-3 {$\cdot$} 41; P =0 {$\cdot$} 01) correlated with disease progression, wherea higher lymphocyte count (OR: 0 {$\cdot$} 11; 95\% CI: 0 {$\cdot$} 02-0 {$\cdot$} 57; P =0 {$\cdot$} 01) and prone ventilation were associated with improvement (OR: 0 {$\cdot$} 11; 95\% CI: 0 {$\cdot$} 01-0 {$\cdot$} 98; P =0 {$\cdot$} 04).Interpretation: The COVID-19 had a low mortality rate in Jiangsu Province, China. In patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, early comprehensive care and oxygen support therapy are the key to success treatment. With non-invasive ventilation or high flow nasal cannula combined prone ventilation might additionally improve hypoxia and protect organ function.Funding Statement: The authors stated that this research was not funded.Declaration of Interests: The authors declare no financial conflicts of interest.Ethics Approval Statement: The research was approved by independent Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University.

As liquid biopsies only require a blood draw, they are non-invasive, potentially more rapid and assumed to be a less costly alternative to genomic analysis of tissue biopsies. A multi-disciplinary workshop (n = 98 registrations) was organized to discuss routine implementation of liquid biopsies in cancer management. Real-time polls were used to engage with experts\&rsquo; about the current evidence of clinical utility and the barriers to implementation of liquid biopsies. Clinical, laboratory and health economics presentations were given to illustrate the opportunities and current levels of evidence, followed by three moderated break-out sessions to discuss applications. The workshop concluded that tumor-informed assays using next-generation sequencing (NGS) or PCR-based genotyping assays will most likely provide better clinical utility than tumor-agnostic assays, yet at a higher cost. For routine application, it will be essential to determine clinical utility, to define the minimum quality standards and performance of testing platforms and to ensure their use is integrated into current clinical workflows including how they complement tissue biopsies and imaging. Early health economic models may help identifying the most viable application of liquid biopsies. Alternative funding models for the translation of complex molecular diagnostics, such as liquid biopsies, may also be explored if clinical utility has been demonstrated and when their use is recommended in multi-disciplinary consensus guidelines.},

  abstract = {Background. Essential hypertension (EH) and cardiovascular disease are common, multifactorial disorders likely to be influenced by multiple genes of modest effect. The C677T methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphism is related to MTHFR enzyme activity and to plasma homocysteine (Hcy) concentration. This study was designed to investigate an association of this polymorphism with coronary artery disease (CAD), EH, and healthy subjects. Methods. In this study, we measured serum folate, serum vitamin B12, and plasma homocysteine and determined the MTHFR C677T genotype of 78 patients with essential hypertension, 100 patients with coronary artery disease, and 100 healthy subjects. MTHFR genotypes were assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results. CC, CT, and TT genotype frequencies were 52, 44.0, and 4.0\% in patients with CAD, respectively. In patients with essential hypertension, the CC, CT, and TT genotype frequencies were 46.2, 41.0, and 12.8\%, respectively. In control subjects, the CC, CT, and TT genotype frequencies were 72.0, 26.0, and 2.0\%, respectively. The C allele was significantly more frequent in controls compared with patients with EH ( p !0.05), and CC genotypes were more frequent in controls compared to patients with EH and CAD. Homocysteine level was higher in TT genotypes in CAD patients compared with CC and CT genotypes ( p !0.01). MTHFR gene polymorphism is an independent risk factor for EH but not for CAD. Conclusions. The TT genotype of the 677C/T MTHFR polymorphism is associated with EH and CAD. In addition, TT genotypes had higher plasma Hcy levels in CAD patients compared with CC and CT genotypes. MTHFR gene polymorphism is an independent risk factor for EH but not for CAD. \'O 2008 IMSS. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) mediates CE/TG exchange among various lipoproteins. CETP deficiency results in low LDL and high HDL phenotype including apoE-rich large HDL. Large HDL could provide apoE to chylomicron/VLDL during lipolysis in post-prandial state, accelerating remnant lipoprotein uptake in the liver. To determine the effects of low CETP levels on post-prandial lipoprotein metabolism, lipid levels of plasma remnant-like lipoprotein particles (RLP) fraction were determined in one homozygous and three heterozygous CETP deficiency and controls with apoE3/3 phenotype. After oral fat-load, the area under curve (AUC) of TG levels were remarkably decreased in CETP deficiency as compared to controls (423+/-187 [S.D.] mg/dl x h in three heterozygous CETP deficiency and 926+/-268 [S.D.] in 10 controls, P=0.012). Similarly, the homozygote had a low AUC of TG levels (416 mg/dl x h). Plasma RLP-cholesterol levels were decreased in heterozygotes, but not significantly as compared to controls (P=0.14). HPLC analysis showed that increased RLP-cholesterol level was not due to conventional VLDL-LDL size RLP, but to those in large HDL size in the homozygote. In heterozygotes, bimodal distribution of RLP-cholesterol level was found in lipoprotein sizes of conventional VLDL-LDL and large HDL. Subjects with CETP deficiency appeared to have low levels of TG response and diminished remnant lipoprotein formation after fat-load.},

We hypothesize that multimodal interventions that address many risk factors simultaneously and are individually tailored to patients may help reduce AD risk. We describe a novel clinical methodology used to evaluate and treat patients at two Alzheimer's Prevention Clinics. The framework applies evidence-based principles of clinical precision medicine to tailor individualized recommendations, follow patients longitudinally to continually refine the interventions, and evaluate N-of-1 effectiveness (trial registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03687710). Prior preliminary results suggest that the clinical practice of AD risk reduction is feasible, with measurable improvements in cognition and biomarkers of AD risk. We propose using these early findings as a foundation to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of personalized risk management within an international network of clinician researchers in a cohort study possibly leading to a randomized controlled trial.},

  abstract = {We employed homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells to produce mice lacking functional LDL receptor genes. Homozygous male and female mice lacking LDL receptors (LDLR-/- mice) were viable and fertile. Total plasma cholesterol levels were twofold higher than those of wild-type litter-mates, owing to a seven- to ninefold increase in intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL) and LDL without a significant change in HDL. Plasma triglyceride levels were normal. The half-lives for intravenously administered 125I-VLDL and 125I-LDL were prolonged by 30-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively, but the clearance of 125I-HDL was normal in the LDLR-/- mice. Unlike wild-type mice, LDLR-/- mice responded to moderate amounts of dietary cholesterol (0.2\% cholesterol/10\% coconut oil) with a major increase in the cholesterol content of IDL and LDL particles. The elevated IDL/LDL level of LDLR-/- mice was reduced to normal 4 d after the intravenous injection of a recombinant replication-defective adenovirus encoding the human LDL receptor driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. The virus restored expression of LDL receptor protein in the liver and increased the clearance of 125I-VLDL. We conclude that the LDL receptor is responsible in part for the low levels of VLDL, IDL, and LDL in wild-type mice and that adenovirus-encoded LDL receptors can acutely reverse the hypercholesterolemic effects of LDL receptor deficiency.},

  abstract = {Background \& aims: Histamine intolerance is a disorder in the homeostasis of histamine due to a reduced intestinal degradation of this amine, mainly caused by a deficiency in the enzyme diamine oxidase (DAO). Among histamine related symptoms, headache is one of the most recorded. Current clinical strategies for the treatment of the symptomatology related to this disorder are based on the exclusion of foods with histamine or other bioactive amines and/or exogenous DAO supplementation. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of a food supplement consisting of DAO enzyme as a preventive treatment of migraine in patients with DAO deficiency through a randomized double-blind trial. Methods: 100 patients with confirmed episodic migraine according to current International Headache Society (IHS) criteria and DAO deficiency (levels below 80 HDU/ml) were randomized in two groups. One group received DAO enzyme supplementation and the other received placebo for one month. Clinical outcomes assessed were duration and number of attacks, perception of pain intensity and adverse effects during treatment. The use of triptans was also recorded. Results: Great variability was found in the duration of migraine attacks reported by placebo and DAO groups. A significant reduction (p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.0217) in hours of pain was achieved in patients treated with DAO supplement, with mean durations of 6.14 ({$\pm$}3.06) and 4.76 ({$\pm$}2.68) hours before and after treatment, respectively. A smaller reduction without statistical signification was also observed for this outcome in the placebo group, from 7.53 ({$\pm$}4.24) to 6.68 ({$\pm$}4.42) hours. Only in DAO group, a decrease in the percentage of patients taking triptans was observed. The number of attacks and the scores of pain intensity showed a similar reduction in both groups. No adverse effects were registered in patients treated with DAO enzyme. Conclusions: Migrainous patients supplemented with DAO enzyme during one month significantly reduced the duration of their migraine attacks by 1.4 h. No statistically significant reduction was found in placebo group before and after treatment. The reduction of pain hours observed in placebo group (0.9 h) could explain the lack of significant differences between both study groups. One month of DAO supplementation has demonstrated a positive trend in the improvement of migraine but more studies with a longer treatment period are needed to better assess the efficacy of DAO supplementation.},

  abstract = {The validation of the use of plasma plant sterols as a marker of cholesterol absorption is frail. Nevertheless, plant sterol concentrations are routinely used to describe treatment-induced changes in cholesterol absorption. Their use has also been advocated as a clinical tool to tailor cholesterol-lowering therapy. Prior to wider implementation, however, the validity of plant sterols as absorption markers needs solid evaluation. Therefore, we compared plasma plant sterol concentrations to gold-standard stable isotope-determined cholesterol absorption. Plasma campesterol/TC concentrations (camp/TC) were measured in a population of 175 mildly hypercholesterolemic individuals (age: 59.7 {$\pm$} 5.6 years; BMI: 25.5 {$\pm$} 2.9kg/m2; LDL-C: 4.01 {$\pm$} 0.56 mmol/l). We compared cholesterol absorption according to the plasma dual-isotope method in subjects with the highest camp/TC concentrations (N = 41, camp/TC: 2.14 {$\pm$} 0.68 {$\mu$}g/mg) and the lowest camp/TC concentrations (N = 39, camp/TC: 0.97 {$\pm$} 0.22 {$\mu$}g/mg). Fractional cholesterol absorption did not differ between the groups (24 {$\pm$} 12\% versus 25 {$\pm$} 16\%, P = 0.60), nor was it associated with plasma camp/TC concentrations in the total population of 80 individuals ({$\beta$}= 0.13; P = 0.30, adjusted for BMI and plasma triglycerides). Our findings do not support a relation between plasma plant sterol concentrations and true cholesterol absorption and, therefore, do not favor the use of these sterols as markers of cholesterol absorption. This bears direct consequences for the interpretation of earlier studies, as well as for future studies targeting intestinal regulation of cholesterol metabolism.},

  abstract = {Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.},

Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Tertiary care teaching hospital. Population Adolescents and young women, 15\textendash 30 years of age, diagnosed with FHA along with concurrent signs of hyperandrogenism (n=22) and body mass index matched control groups consisting of 22 women in each group of FHA-EX and FHA-AN.

Percentage of women with stress fractures was lower in FHA-EX+HA (4.5\%) as compared to both FHA-EX (27.3\%) and FHA-AN (50\%); P=0.04 and 0.01 respectively. The LH/FSH ratio was weakly positively associated with serum glucose (adjusted r2=0.102; P=0.01) as well as with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry spine score (adjusted r2=0.191; P=0.04) in the entire cohort. Conclusion In a small cohort of female athletes with hyperandrogenism, a distinct reproductive hormone profile consisting of higher LH to FHS ratio may be associated with adverse metabolic health markers but improved skeletal health.},

  abstract = {Chronic exposure to multifactorial stress, such as that endured by elite military operators, may lead to overtraining syndrome and negatively impact hormonal regulation. In acute settings ({$<$} 6 mos), military training has been shown to lead to hormonal dysfunction; however, less is known about the consequences of long-term military training. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the chronic effects of military operations and training on the hormone profile of elite military operators. A cross-sectional, random sample of active duty elite US military operators (n = 65, age = 29.8 {$\pm$} 1.0 yrs, height = 178.4 {$\pm$} 0.7 cm, weight = 85.1 {$\pm$} 2.0 kg) concomitantly engaged in rigorous physical training were recruited to participate in the study. Following an overnight fast, waking plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone, total testosterone (TT), free testosterone, sex-hormone binding globulin, cortisol, thyroid stimulating hormone, triiodothyronine, and thyroxine were obtained. Data were analyzed for correlations and compared against normative reference values. There was a significant positive correlation between TT and cortisol (R2 = 0.07; P = 0.038). In addition, 43\% of the participants (n = 28) had TT below age-based normative reference ranges. These results indicate that long-term military operations and training may place a large burden on the operators and depress or alter the hypothalamic pituitary, adrenal, gonadal, and thyroid axes.},

We screened members of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) for variation in three genes -SLC12A3 (NCCT), SLC12A1 (NKCC2) and KCNJ1 (ROMK)- causing rare recessive diseases featuring large reductions in blood pressure. Using comparative genomics, genetics, and biochemistry, we identified subjects with mutations proven or inferred to be functional. These mutations, all heterozygous and rare, produce clinically significant blood pressure reduction and protect from development of hypertension. Our findings implicate many rare alleles that alter renal salt handling in blood pressure variation in the general population, and identify alleles with health benefit that are nonetheless under purifying selection.

Methods ARIC participants were categorized by cardiovascular status in older age (mean age 75.8~{$\pm~$}5.3 years, range 66\textendash 90): healthy, subclinical disease (assessed by biomarkers and left ventricular function), clinical CVD (coronary heart disease, stroke, or heart failure), or prior death. We examined associations of midlife (mean age 52.1~{$\pm~$}5.1 years) systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and body mass index (BMI) with cardiovascular status in older age using multinomial logistic regression analyses. Results Compared with healthy status, odds for subclinical disease (odds ratio [OR] 1.30, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.09\textendash 1.55) and clinical CVD (OR 1.87, 95\% CI 1.53\textendash 2.29) at older age increased starting with midlife SBP 120\textendash 129~mmHg, whereas odds for death increased starting with SBP 110\textendash 119~mmHg (OR 1.29, 95\% CI 1.10\textendash 1.52); findings were similar for DBP.

(1) make the significant observation, by three distinct measures, that the concentrations of remnant lipoproteins (RLPs) in plasma are increased in patients with obesity. This increase in RLPs could explain, in part, the increased cardiovascular risk associated with obesity (2). To date, although LDL- and HDL-cholesterol are clearly accepted as independent risk factors for premature atherosclerosis, the role of plasma triglycerides as a risk factor remains somewhat controversial.Plasma triglycerides are clearly a measure of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs), which derive from both the intestine and the liver. Measurement of plasma triglycerides, however, does not distinguish the various subspecies of TRLs, which clearly have various degrees of atherogenicity. Triglyceride-rich RLPs are formed in the circulation when chylomicrons of intestinal origin [with apolipoprotein B-48 (apo B-48)] and VLDL of hepatic origin (with apo B-100) are converted by lipoprotein lipase (and to a lesser extent by hepatic lipase) into smaller and more dense particles. Compared with their nascent precursors, RLPs are depleted of triglycerides, phospholipids, and apo C and are enriched in cholesteryl esters and apo E and are believed to be more atherogenic than the larger TRLs (3).},

Currently there is no targeted therapeutics and effective treatment options remain very limited. In order to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, we initiated a program of combined structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening to identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 virus main protease (Mpro). Mpro is a key CoV enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive drug target for this virus. Here, we identified a mechanism-based inhibitor, N3, by computer-aided drug design and subsequently determined the crystal structure of COVID-19 virus Mpro in complex with this compound. Next, through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed over 10,000 compounds including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and other pharmacologically active compounds as inhibitors of Mpro. Six of these inhibit Mpro with IC50 values ranging from 0.67 to 21.4 {$\mu$}M. Ebselen also exhibited strong antiviral activity in cell-based assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy, which can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new infectious diseases where no specific drugs or vaccines are available.},

Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Denmark; the Copenhagen General Population Study recruited in 2003-15 with a median follow-up of 9.4 years. Participants Individuals randomly selected from the national Danish Civil Registration System. Main outcome measures Baseline levels of LDL-C associated with risk of mortality were evaluated on a continuous scale (restricted cubic splines) and by a priori defined centile categories with Cox proportional hazards regression models. Main outcome was all cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were cause specific mortality (cardiovascular, cancer, and other mortality). Results Among 108 243 individuals aged 20-100, 11 376 (10.5\%) died during the study, at a median age of 81. The association between levels of LDL-C and the risk of all cause mortality was U shaped, with low and high levels associated with an increased risk of all cause mortality. Compared with individuals with concentrations of LDL-C of 3.4-3.9 mmol/L (132-154 mg/dL; 61st-80th centiles), the multivariable adjusted hazard ratio for all cause mortality was 1.25 (95\% confidence interval 1.15 to 1.36) for individuals with LDL-C concentrations of less than 1.8 mmol/L ({$<$}70 mg/dL; 1st-5th centiles) and 1.15 (1.05 to 1.27) for LDL-C concentrations of more than 4.8 mmol/L ({$>$}189 mg/dL; 96th-100th centiles). The concentration of LDL-C associated with the lowest risk of all cause mortality was 3.6 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) in the overall population and in individuals not receiving lipid lowering treatment, compared with 2.3 mmol/L (89 mg/dL) in individuals receiving lipid lowering treatment. Similar results were seen in men and women, across age groups, and for cancer and other mortality, but not for cardiovascular mortality. Any increase in LDL-C levels was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction. Conclusions In the general population, low and high levels of LDL-C were associated with an increased risk of all cause mortality, and the lowest risk of all cause mortality was found at an LDL-C concentration of 3.6 mmol/L (140 mg/dL).},

  abstract = {AIM: Physical activity and metformin are often used concomitantly in the treatment of diabetes, even though little is known about possible interactions between these treatment modalities. This study was designed to examine the acute effect of metformin on oxygen consumption and lactate concentration during exercise. METHODS: Eleven healthy, active men [mean +/- s.d.: age = 29.9 +/- 3.7 years; body mass index = 25.2 +/- 2.8 kg/m2; maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) = 53.5 +/- 8.9 ml/kg/min] completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. The testing protocol consisted of a standardized breakfast with metformin (1000 mg) or placebo. Three hours after breakfast, participants underwent a graded maximal exercise test on a cycle ergometer. Approximately 30 min after this exercise test, participants cycled continuously at an intensity below their ventilatory threshold for 45 min (mean exercise intensity = 69 +/- 5.5\% of VO2max). RESULTS: During the graded exercise test, average oxygen consumption was higher for the metformin condition (2.9 vs. 2.8 l/min, p = 0.04); however, there was no treatment effect on VO2max or ventilatory threshold. During continuous exercise, lactate was lower for the metformin condition (4.7 vs. 5.4 mmol/l, p = 0.05). Following a standardized lunch, glucose concentrations were lower in the metformin compared with the placebo condition (5.8 vs. 6.4 mmol/l, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: A single dose of metformin does not acutely influence maximal oxygen consumption or ventilatory threshold in healthy active males. The lower lactate concentration observed during continuous exercise with metformin was an unexpected finding considering that, in the resting state, metformin has been previously associated with a modest increase in lactate concentrations.},

However, few data exist on how capsinoid ingestion affects energy expenditure in humans and no data exist on its interaction with exercise. We aimed to determine how ingestion of capsinoids affected energy expenditure, lipid oxidation and blood metabolites at rest and during moderate intensity exercise.MethodsTwelve healthy young men (age = 24.3 {$\pm$} 3 yr, BMI = 25.5 {$\pm$} 1.7 kg{$\cdot$}m-2) were studied on two occasions in a double-blind design following ingestion of either placebo or 10 mg of purified capsinoids at rest, after 90 min of cycling at 55\% VO2 peak, and for 30 min into recovery. Subjects ingested the capsules 30 min prior to exercise.ResultsAt rest, following ingestion of capsinoids, we observed increases in VO2 and plasma norepinephrine levels, and decreases in concentrations of serum free fatty acids, plasma glycerol and the respiratory exchange ratio (all P {$<$} 0.05). At exercise onset, we observed a blunted accumulation of blood lactate with capsinoid ingestion vs. placebo (P {$<$} 0.05). There were no other significant differences between the conditions during or post-exercise.ConclusionThe ingestion of 10 mg of capsinoids increased adrenergic activity, energy expenditure, and resulted in a shift in substrate utilization toward lipid at rest but had little effect during exercise or recovery. The changes we observed confirm previous data on the thermogenic and metabolic effects of capsinoids at rest and further promote its potential role as an adjunct weight loss aid, in addition to diet and exercise.},

Hypertension was originally defined when a participant had blood pressure (BP) {$>$}/=140 and/or {$>$}/=90 mm Hg at any three clinic visits over 4 years. Contemporary guidelines define hypertension if the BP is {$>$}/=140 and/or {$>$}/=90 at two consecutive visits. TROPHY results were recalculated based on the current definition. Participants with repeated BP of 130 - 139 and/or 85 - 89 mm Hg were randomly assigned to 2 years of candesartan or placebo, followed by 2 years of placebo for all. All participants received lifestyle counseling at every visit. When participants reached hypertension, antihypertensive treatment was initiated. The 4-year incidence of hypertension was significantly (P {$<$} .001) lower than previously reported in the placebo (-11.3\%) and candesartan (-11.0\%) groups. During the first 2 years, hypertension developed in 162 placebo and 53 candesartan participants (relative risk reduction [RRR], 68\%; P {$<$} .001; original report 66\%; P {$<$} .001). After 4 years, hypertension occurred in 197 placebo and 165 candesartan participants (RRR, 18\%; P {$<$} .009; original report 16\%; P {$<$} .007). The new definition resulted in a lower incidence of hypertension, but the outcomes were remarkably similar with both definitions and confirmed our original findings.},

SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry depends on binding between the viral Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) target cell receptor. Here, we report on the isolation and characterization of 206 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) derived from single B cells of eight SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. These mAbs come from diverse families of antibody heavy and light chains without apparent enrichment for particular families in the repertoire. In samples from one patient selected for further analyses, we found coexistence of germline and germline divergent clones. Both clone types demonstrated impressive binding and neutralizing activity against pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2. However, the antibody neutralizing potency is determined by competition with ACE2 receptor for RBD binding. Surprisingly, none of the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies nor the infected plasma cross-reacted with RBDs from either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV although substantial plasma cross-reactivity to the trimeric Spike proteins from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was found. These results suggest that antibody response to RBDs is viral species-specific while that cross-recognition target regions outside the RBD. The specificity and neutralizing characteristics of this plasma cross-reactivity requires further investigation. Nevertheless, the diverse and potent neutralizing antibodies identified here are promising candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic SARS-CoV-2 interventions.},

Specifically, we examined whether the cumulative effect of resisting desires, a measure of self-regulatory resource depletion (), relates to bedtime procrastination. Participants (N = 218) reported how many desires they had tried to resist during the previous day and the extent of their bedtime procrastination. Results show that people who attempted to resist more desires were more likely to engage in bedtime procrastination, suggesting that people may be less likely to stick to their intended bedtime after a particularly taxing day.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a Mendelian randomization study design, we measured plasma Lp(a) and genetically elevated Lp(a) levels through the LPA kringle IV type 2 repeat genotype in 41231 individuals. We included 2 general population studies of both venous thrombosis and combined thrombosis and atherosclerosis in coronary arteries (=myocardial infarction), and 3 -case--control studies of atherosclerotic stenosis. Neither Lp(a) tertiles nor LPA kringle IV type 2 tertiles associated with the risk of venous thrombosis in general population studies (trend: P=0.12-0.76), but did each associate with risk of coronary, carotid, and femoral atherosclerotic stenosis in -case--control studies (trend: P{$<$}0.001 to 0.04). Lp(a) and LPA kringle IV type 2 tertiles also associated with the risk of myocardial infarction in general population studies (trend: P{$<$}0.001 to 0.003). For doubling of Lp(a) levels, instrumental variable estimates of hazard/odds ratios were 1.02 (95\% CI 0.90-1.15) and 1.04 (0.93-1.16) for venous thrombosis in the 2 general population studies, 1.12 (1.01-1.25), 1.17 (1.05-1.32), and 1.16 (1.01-1.35), respectively, for coronary, carotid, and femoral atherosclerotic stenosis in -case-control studies, and 1.21 (1.10-1.33) and 1.17 (1.05-1.29) for myocardial infarction in general population studies. CONCLUSIONS: This supports that Lp(a) primarily promotes atherosclerotic stenosis rather than venous thrombosis.},

She also had an asymptomatic tumor in the neck that had developed 8 years earlier. Examination revealed generalized, erythematous scaling plaques over the trunk, arms, and extremities (Fig. 1). An ultrasound and radioisotope scan of the neck disclosed a soft tissue mass compatible with thyroid carcinoma. Laboratory tests showed a white cell count of 9.8X109/L, and triiodothyronine, thyroxin, and calcium levels within the normal range. The thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level was 6.3 {$\mu$}IU/mL (normal range 0.33\textendash 3.6 {$\mu$}IU/mL), and thyroglobulin was 320 {$\mu$}g/mL (normal range 14\textendash 31 {$\mu$}g/mL). A skin biopsy specimen from the upper portion of the arm showed hyperkeratosis with focal parakeratosis and elongation of the rete ridges. The dermis showed mild papillary edema and perivascular lymphocytic infiltration compatible with psoriasis vulgaris. After the biopsy, ampicillin, 1000 mg daily, was administered for 21 days; however, the lesions were unchanged. The patient was then operated on with excision of the thyroid cancer and the regional lymph nodes. Histopathologic examination disclosed an adenocarcinoma of the thyroid; the lymph nodes were infiltrated by tumor cells. After the operation, cefazolin, 2000 mg daily, was given for 9 days. At 2 weeks postoperatively, the lesions began to subside without any dermatologic treatment and then resolved completely within 1 month of the operation (Fig. 2). Three weeks after the excision of the tumor, the patient started to receive levothyroxine sodium (T4), 0.1 mg daily, to compensate for low thyroid hormone production. Within the second postoperative month, TSH, triiodothyronine, and thyroglobulin returned to normal. After excision of the carcinoma, her psoriatic lesions, remained in remission for an additional 5 months without any dermatologic treatment.},

This study examines the relationship between homocysteine and vascular and valve calcification in the MESA (Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) cohort. Methods and Results MESA participants with baseline homocysteine measurements and cardiac computed tomography scans were included (N=6789). Baseline and follow-up assessment of vascular (coronary artery [CAC], descending thoracic aorta [DTAC]) and valve (aortic valve [AVC], mitral annular [MAC]) calcification was performed. Prevalence ratio/relative risk regression was used to assess the relationship of homocysteine with prevalent and incident calcification, and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess associations between homocysteine and calcification progression. Elevated homocysteine was associated with greater relative risk of prevalent and incident CAC and incident DTAC. We also identified a strong association between elevated homocysteine and CAC and DTAC progression. Elevated homocysteine was found to confer a {$>$}2-fold increased risk of severe CAC progression (defined as {$\Delta$}CAC {$\geq$}100/year) and an {$\approx$}1.5-fold increased risk for severe DTAC progression (defined as {$\Delta$}DTAC {$\geq$}100/year). Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating an association between elevated homocysteine and both incidence and progression of coronary and extra-coronary vascular calcification. Our findings suggest a potential role for elevated homocysteine as a risk factor for severe vascular calcification progression.

  abstract = {The effects of magnesium supplementation on blood pressure (BP) have been studied for over 25 years and results have been inconsistent. Blood pressure reductions in randomized studies have varied from 12 mmHg reductions to no reduction. The objective of this pilot intervention was to investigate the effect of magnesium supplementation on systolic blood pressure whilst resting and during recovery from aerobic and resistance exercise and on performance. A further objective was to see whether the effect of a high vs low habitual dietary magnesium intake affected these results. Sixteen male volunteers were randomly assigned to either a 300 mg{$\cdot$}d-1 magnesium oxide supplementation (MO) or a control group (CG) for 14 days. Resting blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were measured before subjects performed a maximal 30 minute cycle, immediately followed by three x 5 second isometric bench press, both at baseline and after the intervention. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded immediately post exercise and after five minutes recovery. A 3 day food diary was recorded for all subjects to measure dietary magnesium intake. At the end of the intervention, the supplemented group, had a reduction in mean resting systolic BP by 8.9 mmHg (115.125 {$\pm$} 9.46 mmHg, p = 0.01) and post exercise by 13 mmHg (122.625 {$\pm$} 9. 88 mmHg, p = 0.01). Recovery BP was 11.9 mmHg lower in the intervention group compared to control (p = 0.006) and HR decreased by 7 beats per minute in the experimental group (69.0 {$\pm$} 11.6 bpm, p = 0. 02). Performance indicators did not change within and between the groups. Habitual dietary magnesium intake affected both resting and post exercise systolic BP and the subsequent effect of the magnesium supplementation. These results have an implication in a health setting and for health and exercise but not performance.,                                        Key points                                                          Magnesium supplementation will have an effect on resting and recovery systolic blood pressure with aerobic exercise.                                               Magnesium supplementation will have an effect on resting and recovery systolic blood pressure with resistance exercise.                                               Magnesium supplementation did not have an effect on performance indicators.                                               A low habitual dietary magnesium intake will negatively affect blood pressure.                                               A high habitual dietary magnesium intake will impact on the effect of magnesium supplementation.},

The aim of the present study was to confirm the genetic risk of these polymorphisms for stroke and cardiovascular events in a cohort study of 515 hypertensive patients in Japan (follow-up period 90.6{$\pm$}30.2 months). The insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the gene encoding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), the M235T amino acid change in angiotensinogen, and the A1166C polymorphism in angiotensin II type 1 receptor were determined by TaqMan PCR. In Kaplan\textendash Meier analyses, the ACE I/D polymorphism was a risk factor for cerebro-cardiovascular events, especially cardiovascular events (P{$<$}0.0001), and the M235T mutation was a risk factor for cardiovascular events (P{$<$}0.0105). The cumulative rates of cerebro-cardiovascular end points for the ACE polymorphism were 10.6, 16.4 and 42.2\% for the II (n=207), ID (n=244) and DD (n=64) genotype carriers, respectively (P{$<$}0.0001). Cox's proportional hazard models revealed that the ACE DD genotype was a risk factor for cerebro-cardiovascular and cardiovascular events (after adjusting for common risk factors), anti-hypertensive treatment and RAS inhibition (P{$<$}0.0001). Moreover, after adjustment for the common risk factors left ventricular hypertrophy and previous myocardial infarction/stroke, these phenomena were preserved. Thus, the DD genotype of ACE may be a genetic risk factor for cerebro-cardiovascular disease, especially cardiovascular events, in hypertensive patients in Japan.},

However, despite clinical evidence of its efficacy, the details of its mechanism remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the site of action and sleep-promoting mechanisms of glycine in rats. In acute sleep disturbance, oral administration of glycine-induced non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and shortened NREM sleep latency with a simultaneous decrease in core temperature. Oral and intracerebroventricular injection of glycine elevated cutaneous blood flow (CBF) at the plantar surface in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in heat loss. Pretreatment with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists AP5 and CGP78608 but not the glycine receptor antagonist strychnine inhibited the CBF increase caused by glycine injection into the brain. Induction of c-Fos expression was observed in the hypothalamic nuclei, including the medial preoptic area (MPO) and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) shell after glycine administration. Bilateral microinjection of glycine into the SCN elevated CBF in a dose-dependent manner, whereas no effect was observed when glycine was injected into the MPO and dorsal subparaventricular zone. In addition, microinjection of D-serine into the SCN also increased CBF, whereas these effects were blocked in the presence of L-701324. SCN ablation completely abolished the sleep-promoting and hypothermic effects of glycine. These data suggest that exogenous glycine promotes sleep via peripheral vasodilatation through the activation of NMDA receptors in the SCN shell.},

In this series, the cause of INO was infarction in 157 patients (38\%), multiple sclerosis in 139 (34\%), and unusual causes in 114 (28\%). Unusual causes included trauma (20 cases), tentorial herniation (20 cases), infection (17 cases), tumor (17 cases), iatrogenic injury (12 cases), hemorrhage (13 cases), vasculitis (7 cases), and miscellaneous (8 cases). Internuclear ophthalmoplegia was unilateral in 136 of the infarct cases (87\%), 38 of those with multiple sclerosis (27\%), and 48 of the unusual cases (42\%). Because unusual causes compose more than one quarter of the cases, the differential diagnosis of INO should be tripartite: multiple sclerosis, stroke, and other causes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The workshop included a select group of panelists with expertise in pancreatic cancer, EHR data mining, and AI-based modeling. This review article reflects the findings from the workshop and assesses the feasibility of AI-based data extraction and modeling applied to EHRs. It highlights the increasing role of data sharing networks and common data models in improving the secondary use of EHR data. Current efforts using EHR data for AI-based modeling to enhance early detection of pancreatic cancer show promise. Specific challenges (biology, limited data, standards, compatibility, legal, quality, AI chasm, incentives) are identified, with mitigation strategies summarized and next steps identified.},

During the past fifteen years fully controlled experi-nents have been increasingly numerous and the methods progressively more sophisticated. Although the mechanisms involved in the body remain obscure, it is generally agreed that the responses of serum cholesterol to changes in the dietary lipids must be the result of the actions of the changes in the several fatty acids and of cholesterol itself in the diet. In 1957 we reported on the analysis of results in many controlled experiments in which it appeared that, other things being equal, under controlled conditions the average serum cho-lesterol response in groups of men to changes in dietary fats can be predicted with reasonable accuracy from information on the percentages of calories provided by glycerides of saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids in the diets being compared. ' Essentially, the controlling factor was the value of the expression 2S-in which S and P are percentages of total cal-ories provided by saturated and polyunsatu-rated fatty acids, respectively. The least squares analysis employed in 1957 failed to show any significant contribution by the monoene, oleic acid, and this was verified in critical experiments in which oleic acid in the diet was varied between wide limits while the other fatty acids were held constant.2},

This testing strategy likely underestimates the true prevalence of infection, creating the need for serologic methods to detect infections missed by the limited testing to date. Here, we describe the development of a coronavirus antigen microarray containing immunologically significant antigens from SARS-CoV-2, in addition to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, common human coronavirus strains, and other common respiratory viruses. A preliminary study of human sera collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic demonstrates overall high IgG reactivity to common human coronaviruses and low IgG reactivity to epidemic coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, with some cross-reactivity of conserved antigenic domains including S2 domain of spike protein and nucleocapsid protein. This array can be used to answer outstanding questions regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection, including whether baseline serology for other coronaviruses impacts disease course, how the antibody response to infection develops over time, and what antigens would be optimal for vaccine development.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a low-density lipoprotein-like particle largely independent of known risk factors and predictive of cardiovascular disease. Statins may offset the risk associated with elevated Lp(a), but it is unknown whether Lp(a) is a determinant of residual risk in the setting of low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol after potent statin therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Baseline and on-treatment Lp(a) concentrations were assessed in 9612 multiethnic participants in the JUPITER trial (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) before and after random allocation to rosuvastatin 20 mg/d or placebo, with outcomes reported for whites (n=7746). Lp(a) concentrations (median [25th-75th percentile], in nmol/L) were highest in blacks (60 [34-100]), then Asians (38 [18-60]), Hispanics (24 [11-46]), and whites (23 [10-50]; P{$<$}0.001). Although the median change in Lp(a) with rosuvastatin and placebo was zero, rosuvastatin nonetheless resulted in a small but statistically significant positive shift in the overall Lp(a) distribution (P{$<$}0.0001). Baseline Lp(a) concentrations were associated with incident cardiovascular disease (adjusted hazard ratio per 1-SD increment in Ln[Lp(a)], 1.18; 95\% confidence interval, 1.03-1.34; P=0.02). Similarly, on-statin Lp(a) concentrations were associated with residual risk of cardiovascular disease (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.27; 95\% confidence interval, 1.01-1.59; P=0.04), which was independent of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and other factors. Rosuvastatin significantly reduced incident cardiovascular disease among participants with baseline Lp(a) greater than or equal to the median (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95\% confidence interval, 0.43-0.90) and Lp(a) less than the median (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95\% confidence interval, 0.30-0.72), with no evidence of interaction. Similar results were obtained when analyses included nonwhites. CONCLUSION: Among white JUPITER participants treated with potent statin therapy, Lp(a) was a significant determinant of residual risk. The magnitude of relative risk reduction with rosuvastatin was similar among participants with high or low Lp(a). CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Approximately 7\% of American adults have severe hypercholesterolemia (untreated low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol~{$\geq$}190 mg/dl), which may be due to familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Lifelong LDL cholesterol elevations in FH mutation carriers may confer coronary artery disease (CAD) risk beyond that captured by~a~single LDL cholesterol measurement. OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the prevalence of an FH mutation among those with severe hypercholesterolemia and determined whether CAD risk varies according to mutation status beyond the observed LDL cholesterol level. METHODS: Three genes causative for FH (LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9) were sequenced in 26,025 participants from 7 case-control studies (5,540 CAD case subjects, 8,577 CAD-free control subjects) and 5 prospective cohort studies (11,908 participants). FH mutations included loss-of-function variants in LDLR, missense mutations in LDLR predicted to be damaging, and variants linked to FH in ClinVar, a clinical genetics database. RESULTS: Among 20,485 CAD-free control and prospective cohort participants, 1,386 (6.7\%) had LDL cholesterol {$\geq$}190~mg/dl; of these, only 24 (1.7\%) carried an FH mutation. Within any stratum of observed LDL cholesterol, risk of CAD was higher among FH mutation carriers than noncarriers. Compared with a reference group with LDL cholesterol {$<$}130 mg/dl and no mutation, participants with LDL cholesterol~{$\geq$}190 mg/dl and no FH mutation had a 6-fold higher risk for CAD (odds ratio: 6.0; 95\% confidence interval: 5.2 to 6.9), whereas those with both LDL cholesterol~{$\geq$}190 mg/dl and~an FH mutation demonstrated a 22-fold increased risk (odds ratio: 22.3; 95\% confidence interval: 10.7 to 53.2). In an analysis of participants with serial lipid measurements over many years, FH mutation carriers had higher cumulative exposure to LDL cholesterol than noncarriers. CONCLUSIONS: Among participants with LDL cholesterol~{$\geq$}190 mg/dl, gene sequencing identified an FH mutation in~{$<$}2\%. However, for any observed LDL cholesterol, FH mutation carriers had substantially increased risk for CAD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND - Oxidized phospholipids (OxPL) circulate on apolipoprotein B-100 particles (OxPL/apoB), and primarily on Lp(a) lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)]. The relationship of OxPL/apoB levels to future cardiovascular events is not known. METHODS AND RESULTS - The Bruneck study is a prospective population-based survey of 40- to 79-year-old men and women recruited in 1990. Plasma levels of OxPL/apoB and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] were measured in 765 subjects in 1995 and incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and transient ischemic attack, was assessed from 1995 to 2005. During the follow-up period, 82 subjects developed CVD. In multivariable analysis, which included traditional risk factors, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) activity, subjects in the highest tertile of OxPL/apoB had a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular events than those in the lowest tertile (hazard ratio[95\% CI] 2.4[1.3 to 4.3], P=0.004). The strength of the association between OxPL/apoB and CVD risk was amplified with increasing Lp-PLA2 activity (P=0.018 for interaction). Moreover, OxPL/apoB levels predicted future cardiovascular events beyond the information provided by the Framingham Risk Score (FRS). The effects of OxPL/apoB and Lp(a) were not independent of each other but they were independent of all other measured risk factors. CONCLUSIONS - This study demonstrates that OxPL/apoB levels predict 10-year CVD event rates independently of traditional risk factors, hsCRP, and FRS. Increasing Lp-PLA2 activity further amplifies the risk of CVD mediated by OxPL/apoB. \textcopyright{} 2007 American Heart Association, Inc.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose Remnant lipoproteins (RLPs) are products of partially catabolized chylomicrons and very-low-density lipoprotein, from which some triglycerides have been removed. These particles are smaller and denser than the parent particles and are believed to be strongly atherogenic. We explored the association between RLP cholesterol (RLP-C) and ischemic stroke, including stroke subtypes. Methods A cohort of 142 ischemic stroke patients (90 men and 52 women; age, 65.2{$\pm$}12.8 years, mean{$\pm$}SD) was enrolled; all had acute infarcts confirmed by diffusion-weighted MRI, and had fasting lipograms. A full stroke-related evaluation was conducted on each patient. An outpatient population of 88 subjects without a history of cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease served as a control group. Serum RLP fractions were isolated using an immunoaffinity gel containing specific antiapolipoprotein (anti-apo)B-100 and anti-apoA-I antibodies. RLP-C values were considered to be high when they were in the highest quartile of all values in the study. Results High RLP-C values were more common in stroke patients than in control patients (31.0\% vs. 14.8\%, p=0.01), when 5.6 mg/dL ({$>$}75th percentile) was used as the cutoff value. Multivariable analyses indicated that RLP-C was a risk factor for stroke, with an odds ratio of 2.54 (p=0.045). The RLP-C level was higher in the large artery atherosclerosis subgroup (5.7{$\pm$}3.9 mg/dL) than in any other stroke subgroup (small vessel occlusion, 4.9{$\pm$}5.9 mg/dL; cardioembolism, 1.8{$\pm$}2.3 mg/dL; stroke of undetermined etiology, 3.1{$\pm$}2.9 mg/dL). Conclusions We have found an association between high RLP-C levels and ischemic stroke, and in particular large artery atherosclerotic stroke.},

Three were younger male individuals (age, 23-36 years) and 1 was a 70-year-old female individual. All 4 had received the second dose of an mRNA vaccine (2 received mRNA-1273 [Moderna], and 2 received BNT162b2 [Pfizer]). All presented with severe chest pain, had biomarker evidence of myocardial injury, and were hospitalized. Coincident testing for COVID-19 and respiratory viruses provided no alternative explanation. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings were typical for myocarditis, including regional dysfunction, late gadolinium enhancement, and elevated native T1 and T2.In this study, magnetic resonance imaging findings were found to be consistent with acute myocarditis in 7 patients; 4 of whom had preceding COVID-19 vaccination.

We hypothesized that low levels of Mg would promote atherosclerotic plaque development in rabbits. New Zealand white rabbits (4 months old, n = 22) were fed an atherogenic diet containing 0.12\% (-Mg), 0.27\% (control), or 0.43\% (+Mg) Mg for 8 weeks. Blood samples were obtained at baseline, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks and were assayed for total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), non-HDL, triglycerides (TG), C-reactive protein, serum Mg, and erythrocyte Mg. Aortas from -Mg had significantly more plaque, with an intima thickness 42\% greater than control and 36\% greater than +Mg. Serum cholesterol levels rose over time, and at 8 weeks, -Mg had the highest and +Mg the lowest total and non-HDL cholesterol and TG levels, although these results did not reach significance. Over time, serum Mg levels increased, and erythrocyte Mg levels decreased. C-reactive protein significantly increased in all groups at 4 and 6 weeks but returned to baseline levels by 8 weeks. This study supports the hypothesis that inadequate intake of Mg results in an increase in atherosclerotic plaque development in rabbits.},

On the basis of the understanding of the cellular mechanisms of thyroid hormone action on the heart and cardiovascular system, it is possible to explain the changes in cardiac output, cardiac contractility, blood pressure, vascular resistance, and rhythm disturbances that result from thyroid dysfunction. The importance of the recognition of the effects of thyroid disease on the heart also derives from the observation that restoration of normal thyroid function most often reverses the abnormal cardiovascular hemodynamics. In the present review, we discuss the appropriate thyroid function tests to establish a suspected diagnosis as well as the treatment modalities necessary to restore patients to a euthyroid state. We also review the alterations in thyroid hormone metabolism that accompany chronic congestive heart failure and the approach to the management of patients with amiodarone-induced alterations in thyroid function tests.},

  abstract = {ContextIn observational studies, individuals with elevated levels of plasma homocysteine tend to have moderately increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). The MTHFR 677C\textrightarrow T polymorphism is a genetic alteration in an enzyme involved in folate metabolism that causes elevated homocysteine concentrations, but its relevance to risk of CHD is uncertain.ObjectiveTo assess the relation of MTHFR 677C\textrightarrow T polymorphism and risk of CHD by conducting a meta-analysis of individual participant data from all case-control observational studies with data on this polymorphism and risk of CHD.Data SourcesStudies were identified by searches of the electronic literature (MEDLINE and Current Contents) for relevant reports published before June 2001 (using the search terms MTHFR and coronary heart disease), hand searches of reference lists of original studies and review articles (including meta-analyses) on this topic, and contact with investigators in the field.Study SelectionStudies were included if they had data on the MTHFR 677C\textrightarrow T genotype and a case-control design (retrospective or nested case-control) and involved CHD as an end point. Data were obtained from 40 (34 published and 6 unpublished) observational studies involving a total of 11 162 cases and 12 758 controls.Data ExtractionData were collected on MTHFR 677C\textrightarrow T genotype, case-control status, and plasma levels of homocysteine, folate, and other cardiovascular risk factors. Data were checked for consistency with the published article or with information provided by the investigators and converted into a standard format for incorporation into a central database. Combined odds ratios (ORs) for the association between the MTHFR 677C\textrightarrow T polymorphism and CHD were assessed by logistic regression.Data SynthesisIndividuals with the MTHFR 677 TT genotype had a 16\% (OR, 1.16; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.28) higher odds of CHD compared with individuals with the CC genotype. There was significant heterogeneity between the results obtained in European populations (OR, 1.14; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.28) compared with North American populations (OR, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.73-1.05), which might largely be explained by interaction between the MTHFR 677C\textrightarrow T polymorphism and folate status.ConclusionsIndividuals with the MTHFR 677 TT genotype had a significantly higher risk of CHD, particularly in the setting of low folate status. These results support the hypothesis that impaired folate metabolism, resulting in high homocysteine levels, is causally related to increased risk of CHD.},

Response to ezetimibe was generally consistent across all subgroups analyzed. Ezetimibe also significantly improved levels of plasma total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, high-density lipoprotein2-cholesterol and lipoprotein(a), and elicited a trend toward lower triglyceride levels. Ezetimibe did not alter the serum concentrations of lipid-soluble vitamins or significantly affect baseline or stimulated cortisol production. Ezetimibe was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of placebo.Conclusions Ezetimibe, which significantly reduces LDL-C and favorably affects other lipid variables, may provide a well tolerated and effective new option for lipid management in the future.},

This includes the use of cloth masks by large sections of the public, as can be seen during the current global spread of COVID-19. However, there is limited knowledge available on the performance of various commonly available fabrics used in cloth masks. Importantly, there is a need to evaluate filtration efficiencies as a function of aerosol particulate sizes in the 10 nm to 10 {$\mu$}m range, which is particularly relevant for respiratory virus transmission. We have carried out these studies for several common fabrics including cotton, silk, chiffon, flannel, various synthetics, and their combinations. Although the filtration efficiencies for various fabrics when a single layer was used ranged from 5 to 80\% and~5 to 95\% for particle sizes of {$<$}300 nm and {$>$}300 nm, respectively, the efficiencies improved when multiple layers were used and when using a specific combination of different fabrics. Filtration efficiencies of the hybrids (such as cotton\textendash silk, cotton\textendash chiffon, cotton\textendash flannel) was {$>$}80\% (for particles {$<$}300 nm) and {$>$}90\% (for particles {$>$}300 nm). We speculate that the enhanced performance of the hybrids is likely due to the combined effect of mechanical and electrostatic-based filtration. Cotton, the most widely used material for cloth masks performs better at higher weave densities (i.e., thread~count) and can make a significant difference in filtration efficiencies. Our studies also imply that gaps (as caused by an improper fit of the mask) can result in over a 60\% decrease in the filtration efficiency, implying the need for future cloth mask design studies to take into account issues of ``fit'' and leakage, while allowing the exhaled air to vent efficiently. Overall, we find that combinations of various commonly available fabrics used in cloth masks can potentially provide significant protection against the transmission of aerosol particles.},

  abstract = {Perspectives in Biology and Medicine 43.2 (2000) 269-276 --William Shakespeare (Sonnet 17) Who was Alexander A. Maximow? This question is not an easy one to answer. He was a brilliant artist making beautiful drawings with dramatic precision. He was a polyglot speaking fluently English, German, French, and Russian. He was a handsome young general wearing tightly fit, elegant uniforms. He was an enthusiastic lecturer and a reckless mountain climber and world explorer. He was a refined Russian aristocrat alienated from his homeland. Maximow wrote "the world's most respected textbook in histology," a book that became a standard text for many generations of medical students and ran to 12 editions [1]. However, above all he was an outstanding scientist who developed and introduced a unitarian theory of hematopoiesis, a theory upon which our present concept of blood cells' origin and differentiation is based. It was my good fortune to study at the Military Medical Academy, St. Petersburg, Russia. As a first-year student, I entered the Department of Histology, and there I first saw a portrait of Alexander A. Maximow in the uniform of a general of the Russian Army. I was told that Maximow headed the department many years ago. I was fascinated by the precision of his numerous drawings, which were still held and carefully preserved at the department's museum. I could not guess at that time that many years later I would find his lost grave. Alexander Alexandrovich Maximow was born in St. Petersburg on 22 January 1874. He was very close to his sister Claudia, who was five years older and looked after her little brother. Maximow studied in the German gymnasium in St. Petersburg and entered the Imperial Military Medical Academy in 1891. His student work on artificially produced amyloid degeneration of the liver was awarded a gold medal. In 1896, when he was 22 years old, Maximow graduated "primus omnium"--literally "the first of all"--that is, the top student in his class [2]. His young age, family background, and excellent education opened a way for an outstanding academic career. He soon successfully defended his doctoral dissertation, entitled Zur Frage pathologischer Regeneration des Hodens (Research on the Pathological Regeneration of the Testes), and was awarded the title of Doctor of Medicine. In 1900, Maximow went to Germany. He worked in Freiburg with Prof. O. Hertwig, in the field of embryology, and with Prof. Zeigler, in experimental pathology. In 1902, he published an excellent monograph on experimental aseptic inflammation. While conducting his investigations, Maximow coined new terms, such as "wandering cells at rest" and "polyblasts." His classic monograph on inflammation "antedates in its findings the later work of many investigators and is still admired today as a pioneering study of great foresight and exactness" [1]. In 1903, Maximow returned to St. Petersburg as Professor of Histology and Embryology at the Military Medical Academy, a position he held until 1922. He married a charming ballerina of the Russian Imperial Ballet and adopted her son Fedor [1]. In 1914, Maximow's textbook The Essence of Histology was published in St. Petersburg and became a standard text for students in Russian universities. In the foreword to the first edition, written by Maximow in June 1913, in Madonna di Campiglio, Italy, he noted that his book consisted of "systematic and slightly enriched material of the lectures I read to the first and second year students of the Imperial Military Medical Academy for the last 10 years" [3]. It is this book, modified, enlarged, and edited, that became the famous Textbook of Histology [4-6]. Maximow learned about the declaration of World War I while he was in Rio de Janeiro, and he immediately returned to his home country [2]. What followed next were most devastating wars and revolutions in Russia. The political turmoil of the late 19th century inspired an intellectual and artistic creativity in Russia that came to be known as the "silver age." During...}

The drug enhances esophageal and gastric motility by acting as a motilin agonist and promoting acetylocholine release. 5-HT3 receptors are involved in the spontaneously occurring migrating motor complex and the effect of erythromycin on antral motility in dogs. The aim of the study was to investigate the hypothesis that 5-HT3 receptors are also involved in the action of erythromycin on the human esophagus. METHODS: A total of 18 healthy volunteers underwent standard esophageal manometry on three different occasions in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized manner, as follows: 1) after placebo, 2) after 200 mg of erythromycin i.v., and 3) after 200 mg of i.v. erythromycin subsequent to pretreatment with either 4 mg of i. v. ondansetron (serotonin receptor antagonist) (10 subjects) or 12 microg/kg of i.v. atropine (8 subjects). RESULTS: Erythromycin significantly increased a) the amplitude of peristalsis at 5 cm (from 87 +/- 19 mm Hg to 108 +/- 26 mm Hg; p = 0.0007), 10 cm (from 72 +/- 24 mm Hg to 81 +/- 26 mm Hg; p = 0.016), and 15 cm (from 47 +/- 15 mm Hg to 55 +/- 17 mm Hg; p = 0.014) proximal to LES, b) the duration of peristalsis at 5 cm (from 4.5 +/- 0.9 s to 5.7 +/- 1.2 s; p {$<$} 0.0001) and 10 cm (from 4.1 +/- 1 s to 4.9 +/- 1 s; p {$<$} 0.0001) proximal to the LES and c) the strength of peristalsis at 5 cm proximal to the LES (from 180 +/- 49 mm Hg x s to 276 +/- 100 mm Hg x s; p {$<$} 0.0001), and decreased the velocity of peristalsis at distal esophagus (from 4.1 +/- 1 cm/s to 3.8 +/- 0.9 cm/s; p = 0.03). In addition, erythromycin significantly increased the resting pressure of the LES (from 36 +/- 10 mm Hg to 44 +/- 12 mm Hg; p = 0.002). Pretreatment with ondansetron totally reversed all of the effects of erythromycin to the placebo state. Pretreatment with atropine not only prevented the effects of erythromycin, but it reduced the amplitude and strength of peristalsis at the distal esophagus at significantly lower levels than after placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Erythromycin exerts its prokinetic action on the lower esophagus by stimulating cholinergic pathways. This action includes not only an increase in LES pressure, but significant increases in the amplitude and duration of esophageal peristalsis, as well. 5-HT3 receptors are also involved in this process.},

Exercise may be an effective non-pharmacological intervention to improve sleep, however, little is known on the effect of resistance exercise. Thus, we performed a systematic review of the literature to determine the acute and chronic effects of resistance exercise on sleep quantity and quality. Thirteen studies were included. Chronic resistance exercise improves all aspects of sleep, with the greatest benefit for sleep quality. These benefits of isolated resistance exercise are attenuated when resistance exercise is combined with aerobic exercise and compared to aerobic exercise alone. However, the acute effects of resistance exercise on sleep remain poorly studied and inconsistent. In addition to the sleep benefits, resistance exercise training improves anxiety and depression. These results suggest that resistance exercise may be an effective intervention to improve sleep quality. Further research is needed to better understand the effects of acute resistance exercise on sleep, the physiological mechanisms underlying changes in sleep, the changes in sleep architecture with chronic resistance exercise, as well its efficacy in clinical cohorts who commonly experience sleep disturbance. Future studies should also examine time-of-day and dose\textendash response effects to determine the optimal exercise prescription for sleep benefits.},

ACR was measured 20 years after baseline when participants were age 43\textendash 50 years (midlife). A generalized additive model was used to examine the association of log ACR as a function of cumulative SBP with adjustment for covariates including SBP measured concurrently with ACR.Cumulative SBP ranged from a low of 1,671 to a high of 3,260 mm Hg. Participants in the highest cumulative SBP quartile were more likely to be male (61.4\% vs. 20.7\%; P \&lt; 0.001), Black (61.5\% vs. 25.6\%; P \&lt; 0.001) and have elevated ACR (18.7\% vs. 4.8\%; P \&lt; 0.001) vs. lowest quartile. Spline regression curves of ACR vs. cumulative SBP demonstrated an inflection point in ACR with cumulative SBP levels \&gt;2,350 mm Hg with linear increases in ACR above this threshold. Adjusted geometric mean ACR values were significantly higher with cumulative SBP {$\geq$}2,500 vs. \&lt;2500 (9.18 [1.06] vs. 6.92 [1.02]; P \&lt; 0.0001).Higher SBP during young adulthood through midlife is associated with higher ACR during midlife.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of heat loss in sleep initiation, under the controlled conditions of a constant-routine protocol modified to permit nocturnal sleep. Heat loss was indirectly measured by means of the distal-to-proximal skin temperature gradient (DPG). A stepwise regression analysis revealed that the DPG was the best predictor variable for sleep-onset latency (compared with core body temperature or its rate of change, heart rate, melatonin onset, and subjective sleepiness ratings). This study provides evidence that selective vasodilation of distal skin regions (and hence heat loss) promotes the rapid onset of sleep.},

  abstract = {Creatine is one of the most popular nutritional ergogenic aids for athletes. Studies have consistently shown that creatine supplementation increases intramuscular creatine concentrations which may help explain the observed improvements in high intensity exercise performance leading to greater training adaptations. In addition to athletic and exercise improvement, research has shown that creatine supplementation may enhance post-exercise recovery, injury prevention, thermoregulation, rehabilitation, and concussion and/or spinal cord neuroprotection. Additionally, a number of clinical applications of creatine supplementation have been studied involving neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., muscular dystrophy, Parkinson's, Huntington's disease), diabetes, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, aging, brain and heart ischemia, adolescent depression, and pregnancy. These studies provide a large body of evidence that creatine can not only improve exercise performance, but can play a role in preventing and/or reducing the severity of injury, enhancing rehabilitation from injuries, and helping athletes tolerate heavy training loads. Additionally, researchers have identified a number of potentially beneficial clinical uses of creatine supplementation. These studies show that short and long-term supplementation (up to 30~g/day for 5 years) is safe and well-tolerated in healthy individuals and in a number of patient populations ranging from infants to the elderly. Moreover, significant health benefits may be provided by ensuring habitual low dietary creatine ingestion (e.g., 3~g/day) throughout the lifespan. The purpose of this review is to provide an update to the current literature regarding the role and safety of creatine supplementation in exercise, sport, and medicine and to update the position stand of International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN).},

Genetic variants including a highly polymorphic copy number variation of the so called kringle IV repeats at this locus have a pronounced influence on Lp(a) concentrations. High concentrations of Lp(a) as well as genetic variants which are associated with high Lp(a) concentrations are both associated with cardiovascular disease which very strongly supports causality between Lp(a) concetrations and cardiovascular disease. This method of using a genetic variant that has a pronounced influence on a biomarker to support causality with an outcome is called Mendelian randomization approach and was applied for the first time two decades ago with data from Lp(a) and cardiovascular disease. This approach was also used to demonstrate a causal association between high Lp(a) concentrations and aortic valve stenosis, between low concentrations and type-2 diabetes mellitus and to exclude a causal association between Lp(a) concentrations and venous thrombosis. Considering the high frequency of these genetic variants in the population makes Lp(a) the strongest genetic risk factor for cardiovascular disease identified so far. Promising drugs that lower Lp(a) are on the horizon but their efficacy in terms of reducing clinical outcomes still has to be shown.},

Additional information among individuals with a high risk of cardiovascular disease complications may help to focus current and future efforts. Subjects and methods We performed a prospective cohort analysis among 8960 middle-aged adults in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. The exposure variables were blood pressure levels: high normal blood pressure, systolic blood pressure 130-139 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure 85-89 mm Hg; and normal blood pressure, systolic blood pressure 120-129 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure 80-84 mm Hg. The outcome was incident cardiovascular disease defined as fatal/nonfatal coronary heart disease, cardiac procedure, silent myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke. Subgroup analysis was performed among blacks, diabetics, individuals aged 55-64 years, individuals with renal insufficiency, and among individuals with varying levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and body mass index (BMI). Results Compared with optimal blood pressure (systolic blood pressure {$<$}120 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure {$<$}80 mm Hg), the relative risk (RR) of cardiovascular disease for high normal blood pressure was 2.33 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.85-2.92), and RR for normal blood pressure was 1.81 (1.47-2.22); among blacks: RR for high normal blood pressure was 3.29 (95\% CI, 1.68-6.45); among diabetics: RR for high normal blood pressure 4.10 (95\% CI, 2.26-7.46); age 55-64 years: RR for high normal blood pressure 2.41 (95\% CI, 1.75-3.30) among individuals with renal insufficiency: RR for high normal blood pressure was 1.90 (95\% CI, 1.34-2.70); among individuals with BMI {$>$}30 kg/m2: RR for high normal blood pressure was 3.56 (95\% CI, 1.99-6.35); and among individuals with LDL {$>$}160 mg/dL, RR for high normal blood pressure was 1.85 (95\% CI, 1.26-2.72). Conclusions Individuals with prehypertensive levels of blood pressure have an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease relative to those with optimal levels. The association is pronounced among blacks, among individuals with diabetes mellitus, and among those with high BMI.},

A new coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the SARS pathogen, which triggered severe pneumonia and acute, often lethal, lung failure. Moreover, among infected individuals influenza such as the Spanish flu and the emergence of new respiratory disease viruses have caused high lethality resulting from acute lung failure. In cell lines, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a potential SARS-CoV receptor. The high lethality of SARS-CoV infections, its enormous economic and social impact, fears of renewed outbreaks as well as the potential misuse of such viruses as biologic weapons make it paramount to understand the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV. Here we provide the first genetic proof that ACE2 is a crucial SARS-CoV receptor in vivo. SARS-CoV infections and the Spike protein of the SARS-CoV reduce ACE2 expression. Notably, injection of SARS-CoV Spike into mice worsens acute lung failure in vivo that can be attenuated by blocking the renin-angiotensin pathway. These results provide a molecular explanation why SARS-CoV infections cause severe and often lethal lung failure and suggest a rational therapy for SARS and possibly other respiratory disease viruses.},

  abstract = {Background: This daily diary study investigates the phenomenon of bedtime procrastination. Bedtime procrastination is defined as going to bed later than intended, without having external reasons for doing so. We highlight the role chronotype (interindividual differences in biological preferences for sleep-wake-times) plays for bedtime procrastination. Moreover, we challenge the view that bedtime procrastination is the result of a lack of self-regulatory resources by investigating momentary self-regulatory resources as a predictor of day-specific bedtime procrastination., Methods: One-hundred and eight employees working in various industries completed a general electronic questionnaire (to assess chronotype and trait self-control) and two daily electronic questionnaires (to assess momentary self-regulatory resources before going to bed and day-specific bedtime procrastination) over the course of five work days, resulting in 399 pairs of matched day-next-day measurements., Results: Results of multilevel regression analyses showed that later chronotypes (also referred to as evening types or `owls') tended to report more bedtime procrastination on work days. Moreover, for late chronotypes, day-specific bedtime procrastination declined over the course of the work week. This pattern is in line with expectations derived from chronobiology and could not be explained by trait self-control. In addition, on evenings on which employees had less self-regulatory resources available before going to bed\textemdash compared to evenings on which they had more self-regulatory resources available before going to bed\textemdash employees showed lower bedtime procrastination. This finding contradicts the prevailing idea that bedtime procrastination is the result of a lack of self-regulatory resources., Conclusion: The findings of this study provide important implications for how bedtime procrastination should be positioned in the field of procrastination as self-regulatory failure and for how bedtime procrastination should be dealt with in practice.},

Methods: We conducted a survey of the Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network Patient Survey Network (BCAN PSN) to investigate the degree of discomfort associated with office-based cystoscopy and prevalence of interventions used to reduce discomfort. All patients had undergone at least one previous cystoscopy. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with moderate-to-severe cystoscopy discomfort. Results: Among 488 BCAN PSN respondents (50\% response rate), 392 responded with demographic data and discomfort score. Cystoscopy was associated with moderate-to-severe discomfort in 52\% of patients. Respondents who reported moderate-to-severe discomfort were more likely to describe their most recent cystoscopy discomfort as worse than prior (P{$<$}0.001) and to be interested in planning discomfort mitigation for cystoscopy (P{$<$}0.001). On multivariable analysis, gender was the only factor independently associated with discomfort, with women reporting less discomfort than men (OR 0.59, 95\%CI 0.37-0.95,P=0.03). Patients reported a wide variety of cystoscopy-specific interventions with differing perceived effectiveness, the most common being intraurethral lidocaine. Conclusions: Over half of patients undergoing office-based cystoscopy for bladder cancer report moderate-to-severe discomfort, constituting a substantial problem among patients undergoing the procedure. Future large pragmatic comparative effectiveness trials are needed to better understand which interventions work most effectively to reduce discomfort associated with cystoscopy. \'O 2021 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) activities were measured in sera from 32 normolipidemic women and men consuming diets enriched in lauric, palmitic, or oleic acids. Serum CETP activity, measured as the rate of radiolabeled cholesteryl esters transferred from HDL toward serum apo B-containing lipoproteins, was higher with the palmitic acid diet (25.1+/-2.5\%) than with the lauric acid (23.7+/-2.4\%) and the oleic acid (24.0+/-2.7\%) diets (P = 0.0028 and 0.0283, respectively). CETP mass concentrations, as measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were increased after the lauric acid diet (2.57+/-0.63 mg/l) and the palmitic acid diet (2.49+/-0.64 mg/l) as compared with the oleic acid diet (2.34+/-0.45 mg/l) (P = 0.0035 and 0.0249, respectively). In contrast with CETP, serum PLTP activity, as measured as the rate of radiolabeled phosphatidylcholine transferred from liposomes toward serum HDL, was significantly higher with the lauric acid diet (23.5+/2.6\%) than with the palmitic acid diet (22.5+/-2.5\%) (P = 0.0013), while no significant differences were noted when comparing the saturated diets versus the oleic acid diet (23.0+/-2.3\%). No significant alterations in the mean apparent diameter of LDL, and in the relative proportions of individual HDL subpopulations were observed from one dietary period to another. Nevertheless, lipid transfer activities correlated significantly with the relative abundance of HDL2b, HDL2a, HDL3b, and HDL3c, with opposite tendencies being observed for cholesteryl ester transfer and phospholipid transfer activities. In general, serum CETP activity correlated negatively with HDL cholesterol, but positively with triglyceride concentrations after the dietary interventions, and the relations with serum lipids were just the opposite for PLTP activity. In addition, CETP and PLTP activities correlated negatively when subjects consumed the standardized diets (P {$<$} 0.05 in all cases), but not when subjects consumed their habitual diet. It is concluded that serum lipid transfer activities in normolipidemic subjects can be significantly affected by the fatty acid content of the diet, with differential effects on CETP and PLTP activities.},

However, the relationship of smaller RBC with physical fitness was unknown. We included 2933 non-anemic military males (hemoglobin levels: 11.1-15.9 g/dL and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) {$<$}100 fL) in Taiwan during 2014. Aerobic fitness was assessed by time for a 3000-meter run, and anaerobic fitness was evaluated by numbers of sit-ups and push-ups, each performed within 2 minutes. Multiple linear and logistic regression models adjusting for age, service specialty, lipid profiles, and hemoglobin levels were used to determine the associations. Microcytosis and normocytosis were defined as MCV {$\leq$} 70 fL (n = 190) and MCV {$>$} 70 fL (n = 2743), respectively. The linear regression shows that as compared with microcytosis, normocytosis was associated with more numbers of sit-ups performed within 2 minutes ({$\beta$} = 1.51, P-value = 0.02). The logistic regression also reveals that those males with microcytosis had higher probability as the worst 10\% performers in the 2-minute push-up test (odds ratio: 1.91, 95\% confidence intervals: 1.18-3.12). By contrast, there was no association of microcytosis with 3000-meter running time. Our study suggests that non-anemic microcytosis was associated with lower anaerobic fitness but not with aerobic fitness. Whether the causative factors for microcytosis such as iron deficiency status and thalassemia trait unavailable in the study might account for the relationship needs further investigations.},

  abstract = {Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL) is a rare genetic disorder of lipid metabolism that is associated with abnormally low serum levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein B. It is an autosomal co-dominant disorder, and depending on zygosity, the clinical manifestations may vary from none to neurological, endocrine, hematological or liver dysfunction. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is common in persons with FHBL, however progression to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is unusual. We describe here a patient with a novel APOB mutation, V703I, which appears to contribute to the severity of the FHBL phenotype. He had liver enzyme abnormalities, increased echogenicity of the liver consistent with steatosis, very low LDL cholesterol at 0.24 mmol/l (normal 1.8\textendash 3.5 mmol/l) and an extremely low apolipoprotein B level of 0.16 g/l (normal 0.6\textendash 1.2 g/l). APOB gene sequencing revealed him to be a compound heterozygote with two mutations (R463W and V703I). APOB R463W has previously been reported to cause FHBL. Genetic sequencing of his first-degree relatives identified the APOB V703I mutation in his normolipidemic brother and father and the APOB R463W mutation in his mother and sister, both of whom have very low LDL cholesterol levels. These results suggest that the APOB V703I mutation alone does not cause the FHBL phenotype. However, it is possible that it has a contributory role to a more aggressive phenotype in the presence of APOB R463W.},

The extent to which the risk attributed to small LDL particles may be independent of concomitant variations in plasma lipoprotein-lipid concentrations remains to be clearly determined, however, particularly through prospective studies. Methods and Results Baseline characteristics were obtained in 2103 men initially free of IHD, among whom 114 developed IHD during a 5-year follow-up period. These 114 case patients were matched with healthy control subjects for age, body mass index, smoking habits, and alcohol intake. LDL peak particle diameter (PPD) was measured a posteriori in 103 case-control pairs by nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of whole plasma. Conditional logistic regression analysis of the case-control status revealed that men in the first tertile of the control LDL-PPD distribution (LDL-PPD{$\leq$}25.64 nm) had a 3.6-fold increase in the risk of IHD (95\% CI, 1.5 to 8.8) compared with those in the third tertile (LDL-PPD{$>$}26.05 nm). Statistical adjustment for concomitant variations in LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B concentrations had virtually no impact on the relationship between small LDL particles and the risk of IHD. Conclusions These results represent the first prospective evidence suggesting that the presence of small, dense LDL particles may be associated with an increased risk of subsequently developing IHD in men. Results also suggest that the risk attributed to small LDL particles may be partly independent of the concomitant variation in plasma lipoprotein-lipid concentrations.},

Sleep is essential for the recovery of the body from both physical and psychological fatigue suffered throughout the day, the refreshment of mind, and the restoration of energy for maintenance of bodily functions. Current thermal comfort theories and standards are mainly concerned with people in waking state. However, many problems regarding thermal environment are found within a few field surveys in bedrooms, pushing out the need to investigate thermal environment and thermal comfort for sleeping people. In this paper, the questions concerning the measurement and evaluation of human sleep quality, the correlation between thermal regulation system and sleep regulation, and the characteristics of night-time space cooling load etc. are answered. The evidences illustrating the effects of thermal parameters on human sleep quality are also provided, in an attempt to shed light on the thermal comfort requirements of sleeping people.},

We measured ad libitum food intake in a laboratory setting and evaluated its relation to body weight and composition, energy expenditure, and macronutrient utilization in 28 women of Pima-Papago heritage (aged 27 +/- 7 y, 85.3 +/- 19.0 kg, 44 +/- 6\% body fat; means +/- SD). All women were studied during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. After a 4-d weight-maintenance period, the volunteers selected their food for 5 d from computerized vending machines offering a variety of familiar and preferred foods, ie, a "cafeteria diet". Twenty-four-hour energy expenditure and substrate oxidation were measured in a respiratory chamber on the 4th d o weight maintenance and the 5th d of ad libitum intake. Average ad libitum intake was 13,732 +/- 4238 kJ/d (11 +/- 1\% protein, 40 +/- 1\% fat, 49 +/- 4\% carbohydrate), ie, moderate overeating by 27 +/- 37\% above weight maintenance requirements (range: -27\% to 124\%). Percent body fat correlated with daily energy intake (r = 0.53, P \&lt; 0.01), the degree of overeating (r = 0.41, P \&lt; 0.05), and the selection of a diet higher in fat and lower in carbohydrate (r = 0.70 and r = -0.63, respectively, P \&lt; 0.001). Excess carbohydrate intake caused an increase in carbohydrate oxidation (r = 0.51, P \&lt; 0.01), whereas excess fat intake resulted in a decrease in fat oxidation (r = -0.53, P \&lt; 0.01) and thus a positive fat balance of 85 +/- 65 g/d. The positive relations among degrees of obesity, dietary fat intake and overeating, and the fact that dietary fat does not induce fat oxidation, support the hypothesis that dietary fat promotes obesity in women.},

Thorough validation of serological tests are required to facilitate their use in the accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmation of molecular results, contact tracing, and epidemiological studies. This study evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of nine commercially available serological tests. These included three enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and six point-of-care (POC) lateral flow tests. The assays were validated using serum samples from: i) SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients with a documented first day of disease; ii) archived sera obtained from healthy individuals before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China; iii) sera from patients with acute viral respiratory tract infections caused by other coronaviruses or noncoronaviruses; and iv) sera from patients positive for dengue virus, cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr virus. The results showed 100\% specificity for the Wantai SARS-CoV-2 Total Antibody ELISA, 93\% for the Euroimmun IgA ELISA, and 96\% for the Euroimmun IgG ELISA with sensitivities of 90\%, 90\%, and 65\%, respectively. The overall performance of the POC tests according to manufacturer were in the rank order of AutoBio Diagnostics {$>$} Dynamiker Biotechnology = CTK Biotech {$>$} Artron Laboratories {$>$} Acro Biotech {$\geq$} Hangzhou Alltest Biotech. Overall, these findings will facilitate selection of serological assays for the detection SARSCoV-2-specific antibodies towards diagnosis as well as sero-epidemiological and vaccine development studies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Macrophage scavenger receptors (MSRs) play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Therefore, local modulation of MSR activity could have a beneficial effect on atherogenesis. METHODS AND RESULTS: We cloned a secreted "decoy" MSR (sMSR) that contains an extracellular portion of the human MSR type AI and constructed an adenoviral vector that directs high-level expression of sMSR in macrophages under the control of the human CD68 promoter. Expression of the sMSR protein inhibited the degradation of (125)I-labeled acetylated LDL and oxidized LDL by murine macrophages up to 90\%. sMSRs also reduced acetylated LDL degradation in MSR knockout mouse peritoneal macrophages by 60\% to 80\%, which suggests that the decoy construct can compete for the uptake mediated via other related scavenger receptors. In addition, sMSRs inhibited foam-cell formation in murine macrophages in the presence of cytochalasin D. The mechanism of inhibition is through ligand binding to the sMSRs, which prevents the ligand binding to MSRs on cell membranes. CONCLUSIONS: The demonstration that recombinant adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of decoy sMSRs can block foam-cell formation suggests a possible new strategy for gene therapy of atherosclerosis and for the treatment of lipid accumulation after arterial manipulations.},

Specific types of chronic, intermittent, or periodic dietary restrictions without chronic caloric restriction have instead the potential to provide a significant healthspan increase while minimizing adverse effects.

Participants were community-living, nonhospitalized adults with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, with COVID-19 symptom onset within 7 days and oxygen saturation of 92\% or greater. One hundred fifty-two participants were enrolled from the St Louis metropolitan area (Missouri and Illinois) from April 10, 2020, to August 5, 2020. The final date of follow-up was September 19, 2020.Participants were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg of fluvoxamine (n\,=\,80) or placebo (n\,=\,72) 3 times daily for 15 days.The primary outcome was clinical deterioration within 15 days of randomization defined by meeting both criteria of (1) shortness of breath or hospitalization for shortness of breath or pneumonia and (2) oxygen saturation less than 92\% on room air or need for supplemental oxygen to achieve oxygen saturation of 92\% or greater.Of 152 patients who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 46 [13] years; 109 [72\%] women), 115 (76\%) completed the trial. Clinical deterioration occurred in 0 of 80 patients in the fluvoxamine group and in 6 of 72 patients in the placebo group (absolute difference, 8.7\% [95\% CI, 1.8\%-16.4\%] from survival analysis; log-rank P\,=\,.009). The fluvoxamine group had 1 serious adverse event and 11 other adverse events, whereas the placebo group had 6 serious adverse events and 12 other adverse events.In this preliminary study of adult outpatients with symptomatic COVID-19, patients treated with fluvoxamine, compared with placebo, had a lower likelihood of clinical deterioration over 15 days.

Relevant articles were retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP (Chinese) database. Results A total of 21 studies met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses suggest that mask use provided a significant protective effect (OR~=~0.35 and 95\% CI~=~0.24\textendash 0.51). Use of masks by healthcare workers (HCWs) and non-healthcare workers (Non-HCWs) can reduce the risk of respiratory virus infection by 80\% (OR~=~0.20, 95\% CI~=~0.11\textendash 0.37) and 47\% (OR~=~0.53, 95\% CI~=~0.36\textendash 0.79). The protective effect of wearing masks in Asia (OR~=~0.31) appeared to be higher than that of Western countries (OR~=~0.45). Masks had a protective effect against influenza viruses (OR~=~0.55), SARS (OR~=~0.26), and SARS-CoV-2 (OR~=~0.04). In the subgroups based on different study designs, protective effects of wearing mask were significant in cluster randomized trials and observational studies. Conclusions This study adds additional evidence of the enhanced protective value of masks, we stress that the use masks serve as an adjunctive method regarding the COVID-19 outbreak.},

  abstract = {The exact pathological processes and triggers for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) are not well understood. We report two patients who developed CIDP after living in a badly water-damaged home which contained very high levels of airborne mold. We also present a short review of the related literature linking exposure to mold and mycotoxins with neurological problems. The patients had nerve conduction velocities, clinical exam findings, and (in one patient) a sural nerve biopsy consistent with CIDP. The patients also developed other new-onset chronic health problems including chronic fatigue, asthma, and neurocognitive problems such as memory and attention deficits. Clinicians who treat patients with CIDP and other peripheral neuropathies need to consider and document environmental and occupational exposures (such as indoor water damage and heavy mold growth) as potential triggers for neurological damage.J Neurol Res. 2017;7(3):59-62doi: https://doi.org/10.14740/jnr413e},

  abstract = {Lipid rafts are involved in the life cycle of many viruses. In this study, we showed that lipid rafts also play an important role in the life cycle of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV). Cholesterol depletion by pretreatment of Vero E6 cells with methyl-{$\beta$}-cyclodextrin (M{$\beta$}CD) inhibited the production of SARS-CoV particles released from the infected cells. This inhibition was prevented by addition of cholesterol to the culture medium, indicating that the reduction of virus particle release was caused by the loss of cholesterol in the cell membrane. In contrast, cholesterol depletion at the post-entry stage (3h post-infection) caused only a limited effect on virus particle release. Northern blot analysis revealed that the levels of viral mRNAs were significantly affected by pretreatment with M{$\beta$}CD, but not by treatment at 3h post-infection. Interestingly, no apparent evidence for colocalization of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 with lipid rafts in the membrane of Vero E6 cells was obtained. These results suggest that lipid rafts could contribute to SARS-CoV infection in the early replication process in Vero E6 cells.},

  abstract = {In humans, uric acid is the final oxidation product of purine catabolism. The serum uric acid level is based on the balance between the absorption, production and excretion of purine. Uric acid is similarly produced in the liver, adipose tissue and muscle and is primarily excreted through the urinary tract. Several factors, including a high-fructose diet and the use of xenobiotics and alcohol, contribute to hyperuricaemia. Hyperuricaemia belongs to a cluster of metabolic and haemodynamic abnormalities, called metabolic syndrome, characterised by abdominal obesity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia and hypertension. Hyperuricaemia reduction in the Pound mouse or fructose-fed rats, as well as hyperuricaemia induction by uricase inhibition in rodents and studies using cell culture have suggested that uric acid plays an important role in the development of metabolic syndrome. These studies have shown that high uric acid levels regulate the oxidative stress, inflammation and enzymes associated with glucose and lipid metabolism, suggesting a mechanism for the impairment of metabolic homeostasis. Humans lacking uricase, the enzyme responsible for uric acid degradation, are susceptible to these effects. In this review, we summarise the current knowledge of the effects of uric acid on the regulation of metabolism, primarily focusing on liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle.},

Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted.Colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, test accuracy in detecting CRC or adenomas, and serious adverse events.Four pragmatic randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating 1-time or 2-time flexible sigmoidoscopy (n\,=\,458\,002) were associated with decreased CRC-specific mortality compared with no screening (incidence rate ratio, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.66-0.82). Five RCTs with multiple rounds of biennial screening with guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing (n\,=\,419\,966) showed reduced CRC-specific mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.91; 95\% CI, 0.84-0.98, at 19.5 years to RR, 0.78; 95\% CI, 0.65-0.93, at 30 years). Seven studies of computed tomographic colonography (CTC) with bowel preparation demonstrated per-person sensitivity and specificity to detect adenomas 6 mm and larger comparable with colonoscopy (sensitivity from 73\% [95\% CI, 58\%-84\%] to 98\% [95\% CI, 91\%-100\%]; specificity from 89\% [95\% CI, 84\%-93\%] to 91\% [95\% CI, 88\%-93\%]); variability and imprecision may be due to differences in study designs or CTC protocols. Sensitivity of colonoscopy to detect adenomas 6 mm or larger ranged from 75\% (95\% CI, 63\%-84\%) to 93\% (95\% CI, 88\%-96\%). On the basis of a single stool specimen, the most commonly evaluated families of fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) demonstrated good sensitivity (range, 73\%-88\%) and specificity (range, 90\%-96\%). One study (n\,=\,9989) found that FIT plus stool DNA test had better sensitivity in detecting CRC than FIT alone (92\%) but lower specificity (84\%). Serious adverse events from colonoscopy in asymptomatic persons included perforations (4/10\,000 procedures, 95\% CI, 2-5 in 10\,000) and major bleeds (8/10\,000 procedures, 95\% CI, 5-14 in 10\,000). Computed tomographic colonography may have harms resulting from low-dose ionizing radiation exposure or identification of extracolonic findings. Colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, CTC, and stool tests have differing levels of evidence to support their use, ability to detect cancer and precursor lesions, and risk of serious adverse events in average-risk adults. Although CRC screening has a large body of supporting evidence, additional research is still needed.},

Design: Multicentre retrospective observational cohort study. Setting: Three multidisciplinary intensive care units (ICUs) in Hong Kong. Participants: All adult critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to ICUs in Hong Kong between 22 January and 11 February 2020. Main outcome measure: 28-day mortality. Results: Eight out of 49 patients with COVID-19 (16\%) were admitted to Hong Kong ICUs during the study period. The median age was 64.5 years (range, 42\textendash 70) with a median admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 6 (IQR, 4\textendash 7). Six patients (75\%) required mechanical ventilation, six patients (75\%) required vasopressors and two (25\%) required renal replacement therapy. None of the patients required prone ventilation, nitric oxide or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The median times to shock reversal and extubation were 9 and 11 days respectively. At 28 days, one patient (12\%) had died and the remaining seven (88\%) all survived to ICU discharge. Only one of the survivors (14\%) still required oxygen at 28 days. Conclusion: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 often require a moderate duration of mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support. Most of these patients recover and survive to ICU discharge with supportive care using lung protective ventilation strategies, avoiding excess fluids, screening and treating bacterial co-infection, and timely intubation. Lower rather than upper respiratory tract viral burden correlates with clinical severity of illness.},

  abstract = {Atherosclerosis is the underlying cause of heart attack and stroke. Early observations that cholesterol is a key component of arterial plaques gave rise to the cholesterol hypothesis for the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Population studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B (apoB) 100, the main structural protein of LDL, are directly associated with risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular events (ASCVE). Indeed, infiltration and retention of apoB containing lipoproteins in the artery wall is a critical initiating event that sparks an inflammatory response and promotes the development of atherosclerosis. Arterial injury causes endothelial dysfunction promoting modification of apoB containing lipoproteins and infiltration of monocytes into the subendothelial space. Internalization of the apoB containing lipoproteins by macrophages promotes foam cell formation, which is the hallmark of the fatty streak phase of atherosclerosis. Macrophage inflammation results in enhanced oxidative stress and cytokine/chemokine secretion, causing more LDL/remnant oxidation, endothelial cell activation, monocyte recruitment, and foam cell formation. HDL, apoA-I, and endogenous apoE prevent inflammation and oxidative stress and promote cholesterol efflux to reduce lesion formation. Macrophage inflammatory chemoattractants stimulate infiltration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells. Smooth muscle cells produce the extracellular matrix providing a stable fibrous barrier between plaque prothrombotic factors and platelets. Unresolved inflammation results in formation of vulnerable plaques characterized by enhanced macrophage apoptosis and defective efferocytosis of apoptotic cells resulting in necrotic cell death leading to increased smooth muscle cell death, decreased extracellular matrix production, and collagen degradation by macrophage proteases. Rupture of the thinning fibrous cap promotes thrombus formation resulting in clinical ischemic ASCVE. Surprisingly, native LDL is not taken up by macrophages in vitro but has to be modified to promote foam cell formation. Oxidative modification converts LDL into atherogenic particles that initiate inflammatory responses. Uptake and accumulation of oxidatively modified LDL (oxLDL) by macrophages initiates a wide range of bioactivities that may drive development of atherosclerotic lesions. Lowering LDL-cholesterol with statins reduces risk for cardiovascular events, providing ultimate proof of the cholesterol hypothesis. All of the apoB containing lipoproteins are atherogenic, and both triglyceride rich remnant lipoproteins and Lp(a) promote atherothrombosis. Non-HDL cholesterol levels capture all of the apoB containing lipoproteins in one number and are useful in assessing risk in the setting of hypertriglyceridemia. Measures of apoB and LDL-P are superior at predicting risk for ASCVE, when levels of LDL-C and LDL-P are discordant. Here, we also describe the current landscape of HDL metabolism. Epidemiological studies have consistently shown that HDL-C levels are inversely related to ASCVE. We highlight recent clinical trials aimed at raising HDL-C that failed to reduce CVE and the shifting clinical targets of HDL-C, HDL particle numbers, and HDL function (e.g. cholesterol efflux capacity). Furthermore, we describe many beneficial properties of HDL that antagonize atherosclerosis and how HDL dysfunction may promote cardiometabolic disease.},

The aim of this analysis is to determine the association of cardiovascular metabolic diseases with the development of COVID-19. Methods\hspace{0.6em} A meta-analysis of eligible studies that summarized the prevalence of cardiovascular metabolic diseases in COVID19 and compared the incidences of the comorbidities in ICU/severe and non-ICU/severe patients was performed. Embase and PubMed were searched for relevant studies. Results\hspace{0.6em} A total of six studies with 1527 patients were included in this analysis. The proportions of hypertension, cardiacerebrovascular disease and diabetes in patients with COVID-19 were 17.1\%, 16.4\% and 9.7\%, respectively. The incidences of hypertension, cardia-cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes were about twofolds, threefolds and twofolds, respectively, higher in ICU/severe cases than in their non-ICU/severe counterparts. At least 8.0\% patients with COVID-19 suffered the acute cardiac injury. The incidence of acute cardiac injury was about 13 folds higher in ICU/severe patients compared with the non-ICU/severe patients. Conclusion\hspace{0.6em} Patients with previous cardiovascular metabolic diseases may face a greater risk of developing into the severe condition and the comorbidities can also greatly affect the prognosis of the COVID-19.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: More than 1 million prostate biopsies are performed annually among Medicare beneficiaries. We determined the risk of serious complications requiring hospitalization. We hypothesized that with emerging multidrug resistant organisms there may be an increasing risk of infectious complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a 5\% random sample of Medicare participants in SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) regions from 1991 to 2007 we compared 30-day hospitalization rates and ICD-9 primary diagnosis codes for admissions between 17,472 men who underwent prostate biopsy and a random sample of 134,977 controls. Multivariate logistic and Poisson regression were used to examine the risk and predictors of serious infectious and noninfectious complications with time. RESULTS: The 30-day hospitalization rate was 6.9\% within 30 days of prostate biopsy, which was substantially higher than the 2.7\% in the control population. After adjusting for age, race, SEER region, year and comorbidities prostate biopsy was associated with a 2.65-fold (95\% CI 2.47-2.84) increased risk of hospitalization within 30 days compared to the control population (p {$<$}0.0001). The risk of infectious complications requiring hospitalization after biopsy was significantly greater in more recent years (p(trend) = 0.001). Among men undergoing biopsy, later year, nonwhite race and higher comorbidity scores were significantly associated with an increased risk of infectious complications. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of hospitalization within 30 days of prostate biopsy was significantly higher than in a control population. Infectious complications after prostate biopsy have increased in recent years while the rate of serious noninfectious complications is relatively stable. Careful patient selection for prostate biopsy is essential to minimize the potential harms.},

A promising new test based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is called the Prostate Health Index (PHI), which has recently been approved in the United States, Europe and Australia. PHI is a mathematical formula that combines total PSA, free PSA and [-2] proPSA. Numerous international studies have consistently shown that PHI outperforms its individual components for the prediction of overall and high-grade prostate cancer on biopsy. PHI also predicts the likelihood of progression during active surveillance, providing another noninvasive modality to potentially select and monitor this patient population.

To assess the effect of homocysteine-lowering B-vitamin treatment on angiographic progression of coronary artery disease, this substudy of the Western Norway B Vitamin Intervention Trial (WENBIT) included patients who had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention. The patients were randomized to daily oral treatment with folic acid, vitamin B(12), and vitamin B(6) or placebo in a 2 x 2 factorial design. The coronary angiograms obtained at baseline and follow-up were evaluated. The primary angiographic end points were the changes in minimum lumen diameter and diameter stenosis. A total of 348 subjects (288 men) with a mean +/- SD age of 60 +/- 10.2 years were followed up for a median of 10.5 months (twenty-fifth, seventy-fifth percentile 9.2, 11.8). The baseline median plasma tHcy level was 10.0 mumol/L (twenty-fifth, seventy-fifth percentile 8.1, 11.0), and treatment with folic acid/vitamin B(12) lowered the tHcy levels by 22\%. At follow-up, we found 309 lesions with a significant decrease from baseline in the minimum lumen diameter of a mean of -0.16 +/- 0.4 mm and an increase in the diameter stenosis of 4.4 +/- 0.7\%. Treatment with folic acid/vitamin B(12) or vitamin B(6) was not associated with a change in diameter stenosis or minimum lumen diameter. In a post hoc analysis, folic acid/vitamin B(12) treatment was significantly associated with rapid progression (odds ratio 1.84, 95\% confidence interval 1.07 to 3.18). In conclusion, vitamin B treatment showed no beneficial effect on the angiographic progression of coronary artery disease, and the post hoc analyses suggested that folic acid/vitamin B(12) treatment might promote more rapid progression.},

  abstract = {One-tailed statistical tests are often used in ecology, animal behaviour and in most other fields in the biological and social sciences. Here we review the frequency of their use in the 1989 and 2005 volumes of two journals (Animal Behaviour and Oecologia), their advantages and disadvantages, the extensive erroneous advice on them in both older and modern statistics texts and their utility in certain narrow areas of applied research. Of those articles with data sets susceptible to one-tailed tests, at least 24\% in Animal Behaviour and at least 13\% in Oecologia used one-tailed tests at least once.They were used 35\% more frequently with nonparametric methods than with parametric ones and about twice as often in 1989 as in 2005. Debate in the psychological literature of the 1950s established the logical criterion that one-tailed tests should be restricted to situations where there is interest only in results in one direction. `Interest' should be defined; however, in terms of collective or societal interest and not by the individual investigator. By this `collective interest' criterion, all uses of one-tailed tests in the journals surveyed seem invalid. In his book Nonparametric Statistics, S. Siegel unrelentingly suggested the use of one-tailed tests whenever the investigator predicts the direction of a result.That work has been a major proximate source of confusion on this issue, but so are most recent statistics textbooks. The utility of one-tailed tests in research aimed at obtaining regulatory approval of new drugs and new pesticides is briefly described, to exemplify the narrow range of research situations where such tests can be appropriate.These situations are characterized by null hypotheses stating that the difference or effect size does not exceed, or is at least as great as, some `amount of practical interest'. One-tailed tests rarely should be used for basic or applied research in ecology, animal behaviour or any other science.},

There was consensus that there is sufficient evidence that aging interventions will delay and prevent disease onset for many chronic conditions of adult and old age. Essential pathways have been identified, and behavioral, dietary, and pharmacologic approaches have emerged. Although many gene targets and drugs were discussed and there was not complete consensus about all interventions, the participants selected a subset of the most promising strategies that could be tested in humans for their effects on healthspan. These were: (i) dietary interventions mimicking chronic dietary restriction (periodic fasting mimicking diets, protein restriction, etc.); (ii) drugs that inhibit the growth hormone/IGF-I axis; (iii) drugs that inhibit the mTOR\textendash S6K pathway; or (iv) drugs that activate AMPK or specific sirtuins. These choices were based in part on consistent evidence for the pro-longevity effects and ability of these interventions to prevent or delay multiple age-related diseases and improve healthspan in simple model organisms and rodents and their potential to be safe and effective in extending human healthspan.

People with hyperhidrosis may sweat even when the temperature is cool or when they are at rest.Despite prevalence of at least 1\% of the global population, Hyperhidrosis is still an unknown entity, for the most part -- an undertreated and even neglected medical condition. Moreover, there are few sources summarizing the knowledge on hyperhidrosis to a wider audience. The purpose of this book is to provide information regarding hyperhidrosis, ranging from basic information on pathophysiology to the most advanced therapeutic alternatives. From a therapeutic perspective, hyperhidrosis requires clinical treatment using topical and subdermal agents as well as surgical approaches. The book will not only cover these topics but will discuss all aspects of care -- from patient selection through post-surgical complications. Special attention will be given to sympathectomies. Medical and paramedical professionals, as well as students and researchers, interested in the topic will find the book comprehensive in scope and targeted in offering practical, clinical guidance. Diagnosis and Treatment of Hyperhidrosis - A Complete Guide counts with the collaboration of most renowned specialists of this field, and is intended as an easy to read and very practical reference book.},

  abstract = {Background: Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) outbreaks in Wuhan, China, healthcare systems capacities in highly endemic areas have been overwhelmed. Approaches to efficient management are urgently needed and key to a quicker control of the outbreaks and casualties. We aimed to characterize the clinical features of hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and develop a mortality risk index for COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this retrospective one-centre cohort study, we included all the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a COVID-19-designated hospital from January 21 to February 5, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and clinical outcome data were collected from the hospital information system, nursing records and laboratory reports. Findings: Of 577 patients with at least one post-admission evaluation, the median age was 55 years (interquartile range [IQR], 39 - 66); 254 (44{$\cdot$}0\%) were men; 22{$\cdot$}8\% (100/438) were severe pneumonia on admission, and 37{$\cdot$}7\% (75/199) patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive. The clinical, laboratory and radiological data were comparable between positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 patients. During a median follow-up of 8{$\cdot$}4 days (IQR, 5{$\cdot$}8 - 12{$\cdot$}0), 39 patients died with a 12-day cumulative mortality of 8{$\cdot$}7\% (95\% CI, 5{$\cdot$}9\% to 11{$\cdot$}5\%). A simple mortality risk index (called ACP index), composed of Age and C-reactive Protein, was developed. By applying the ACP index, patients were categorized into three grades. The 12-day cumulative mortality in grade three (age {$\geq$} 60 years and CRP {$\geq$} 34 mg/L) was 33{$\cdot$}2\% (95\% CI, 19{$\cdot$}8\% to 44{$\cdot$}3\%), which was significantly higher than those of grade two (age {$\geq$} 60 years and CRP {$<$} 34 mg/L; age {$<$} 60 years and CRP {$\geq$} 34 mg/L; 5{$\cdot$}6\% [95\% CI, 0 to 11{$\cdot$}3\%]) and grade one (age {$<$} 60 years and CRP {$<$} 34 mg/L, 0\%) (P {$<$}0{$\cdot$}001), respectively. Interpretation: The ACP index can predict COVID-19 related short-term mortality, which may be a useful and convenient tool for quickly establishing a COVID-19 hierarchical management system that can greatly reduce the medical burden and therefore mortality in highly endemic areas. Funding Statement: Local Innovative and Research Teams Project of Guangdong Pearl River Talents Program.Declaration of Interests: The authors stated: "None reported."Ethics Approval Statement: The study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and the principles of good clinical practice, and was approved by the Nanfang Hospital Ethics Committee (NFEC-2020-026).},

METHODS: A total of 1008 participants with high-normal office blood pressure were randomized to ramipril treatment group (n = 505) and a control group (n = 503). The patients were followed up for 3 years. Primary endpoint was to prevent or delay the progression to manifest hypertension. Secondary endpoints were reduction in the incidence of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events, as well as the development of hypertension as defined by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. FINDINGS: One hundred and fifty-five patients (30.7\%) in the ramipril group, and 216 (42.9\%) in the control group reached the primary endpoint (relative risk reduction 34.4\%, P = 0.0001). Ramipril also proved to be more effective in reducing the incidence of manifest office hypertension in patients with baseline ambulatory blood pressure monitoring high-normal blood pressure. The incidence of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events showed no statistically significant differences between the two groups. Cough was more frequent in the ramipril group (4.8 vs. 0.4\%). INTERPRETATION: There is now good clinical evidence that patients with high-normal blood pressure (prehypertension) are more likely to progress to manifest hypertension than patients with optimal or normal blood pressure. Additional ambulatory blood pressure monitoring seems to be essential to achieve correct diagnosis. Treatment of patients with high-normal office blood pressure with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was well tolerated, and significantly reduced the risk of progression to manifest hypertension.},

  abstract = {With an increasing global burden of coronary artery disease (CAD), early detection and timely management of risk factors are crucial to reduce morbidity and mortality in such patients. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is considered an independent risk factor for the development of CAD. Metformin, an anti-diabetic drug, has been shown in pre-clinical and clinical studies, to lower the cardiovascular events in the DM patients. Growing evidence suggests that metformin has a protective effect on coronary artery beyond its hypoglycemic effects. Given its global availability, route of administration and cost, metformin provides an alternate/additional therapeutic option for primary and secondary prevention of CAD in DM and non-diabetics alike. Future prospective cohort-based studies and randomized clinical trials are needed to identify `at-risk' population who may potentially benefit from metformin.},

Blood pressure was directly recorded by means of a capacitance transducer connected to a catheter in the brachial artery. Intrathoracic pressure with the Valsalva maneuver was recorded as mouth pressure by having the subject maintain an open glottis while expiring against a column of Hg during the lifts. Exercises included single-arm curls, overhead presses, and both double- and single-leg presses performed to failure at 80, 90, 95, and 100\% of maximum. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures rose rapidly to extremely high values during the concentric contraction phase for each lift and declined with the eccentric contraction. The greatest peak pressures occurred during the double-leg press where the mean value for the group was 320/250 mmHg, with pressures in one subject exceeding 480/350 mmHg. Peak pressures with the single-arm curl exercise reached a mean group value of 255/190 mmHg when repetitions were continued to failure. Mouth pressures of 30-50 Torr during a single maximum lift, or as subjects approached failure with a submaximal weight, indicate that a portion of the observed increase in blood pressure was caused by a Valsalva maneuver. It was concluded that when healthy young subjects perform weight-lifting exercises the mechanical compression of blood vessels combines with a potent pressor response and a Valsalva response to produce extreme elevations in blood pressure. Pressures are extreme even when exercise is performed with a relatively small muscle mass.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The objective of this study was to determine whether a very low presenting prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was associated with greater prostate cancer\textendash specific mortality (PCSM) among men with a Gleason score (GS) of 8 to 10. METHODS The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program was used to identify 328,904 men diagnosed with clinicalT1 (cT1)-4N0M0 prostate cancer between 2004 and 2010. A multivariate Fine-Gray competing risks regression analysis was used to determine PCSM as a function of the PSA level ({$\leq$}2.5, 2.6-4, 4.1-10, 10.1-20, 20.1-40, or {$>$} 40 ng/mL) and GS (8-10 vs {$\leq$} 7). RESULTS The median follow-up was 38 months. Among men with GS 8-10 disease, with a PSA level of 4.1 to 10 ng/mL as the referent, the adjusted hazard ratio for PCSM for men was 2.15 with a PSA level {$\leq$} 2.5 ng/mL (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.65-2.79; P {$<$} .001), 1.60 with a PSA level of 2.6 to 4 ng/mL (95\% CI, 1.22-2.10; P = .001), 1.60 with a PSA level of 10.1 to 20 ng/mL (95\% CI, 1.41-1.82; P {$<$} .001), 2.08 with a PSA level of 20.1 to 40 ng/mL (95\% CI, 1.81-2.38; P {$<$} .001), and 3.23 with a PSA level {$>$} 40 ng/mL (95\% CI, 2.85-3.65; P {$<$} .001). This suggested a U-shaped distribution. There was a significant interaction between the PSA level and GS (Pinteraction {$<$} .001) such that only a PSA level {$\leq$} 2.5 ng/mL significantly predicted poorer PCSM among patients with GS 8-10 disease. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with high-grade disease, patients with PSA levels {$\leq$} 2.5 ng/mL or PSA levels of 2.6 to 4 ng/mL appear to have a higher risk for cancer-specific death in comparison with patients with PSA levels of 10.1 to 20 ng/mL, and this supports the notion that low PSA levels in GS 8-10 disease may be a sign of aggressive and very poorly differentiated or anaplastic low PSA\textendash producing tumors. Patients with low-PSA, GS 8-10 disease should be considered for clinical trials studying the use of chemotherapy and other novel agents for very high-risk prostate cancers.

Distribution of lipoprotein subclasses in patients with T2DM who have achieved very low levels of LDL cholesterol ({$<$}50 mg/dl) or non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ({$<$}80 mg/dl) have not been extensively examined. The aim of this study was to assess variations in lipoprotein particle concentration in patients with diabetes with "very low" LDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol levels to elucidate the drivers of residual cardiovascular risk. Data were selected from a single large clinical laboratory database. Cases were patients with T2DM diagnosis codes (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes 250 to 250.93). Lipoprotein particle concentrations were analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The Friedewald equation was used to calculate LDL cholesterol. Among the 1,970 patients with T2DM, the mean age was 61 years, and approximately 51\% were men. At LDL cholesterol concentrations {$<$}50 mg/dl (triglyceride {$<$}150 mg/dl and HDL cholesterol {$>$}40 mg/dl), 16\% had LDL particle concentrations {$<$}500 nmol/L, 70\% had concentrations of 500 to 1,000 nmol/L, and 14\% had concentrations {$>$}1,001 nmol/L. At non-HDL cholesterol levels {$<$}80 mg/dl, 8\% had LDL particle concentrations {$<$}500 nmol/L, 67\% had concentrations of 500 to 1,000 nmol/L, and 25\% had concentrations {$>$}1,001 nmol/L. In conclusion, despite attainment of LDL cholesterol {$<$}50 mg/dl or non-HDL cholesterol {$<$}80 mg/dl, patients with diabetes exhibited significant variation in LDL particle levels, with most having LDL particle concentrations {$>$}500 nmol/L, suggesting the persistence of potential residual coronary heart disease risk.},

Aim: This study was to compare the effectiveness of two oral hygiene aids: Chewing stick and manual toothbrush, for plaque removal and gingival health after one month of a randomized clinical trial. Materials and Methods: Dental students (age 18-22 years) of a public sector dental hospital were recruited. Sample size was determined using the American Dental Association guidelines. Participants were randomized into two interventional groups and provided with either chewing sticks or toothbrushes. Pre- and post-intervention examinations were executed by two blind and calibrated examiners using plaque and gingival dental indices. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, paired t-test, and two sample independent t-tests. Results: Fifty subjects were recruited with mean age 20 {$\pm$} 0.66 years (80\% were females and 20\% were males). Except for the mean plaque scores of toothbrush users (which increased at post-intervention examination), all other scores showed reduction. In contrast to the final mean gingival scores, a significant difference (P = {$<$} 0.0001) in the final mean plaque score was observed for the two respective interventional groups. Conclusion: Chewing stick has revealed parallel and at times greater mechanical and chemical cleansing of oral tissues as compared to a toothbrush.},

Whether the addition of metformin has additive effects on fat oxidation during and after exercise is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of metformin on substrate oxidation during and after exercise. Using a double-blind, counter-balanced crossover design, substrate oxidation was assessed by indirect calorimetry in 15 individuals taking metformin (2,000 mg/d) and placebo for 8-10 d. Measurements were made during cycle exercise at 5 submaximal cycle workloads, starting at 30\% peak work (W(peak)) and increasing by 10\% every 8 min to 70\% W(peak). Substrate oxidation was also measured for 50 min postexercise. Differences between conditions were assessed using analysis of variance with repeated measures, and values are reported as M + or - SE. During exercise, fat oxidation (0.19 + or - 0.03 vs. 0.15 + or - 0.01 g/min, p {$<$} .01) and percentage of energy from fat (32\% + or - 3\% vs. 28\% + or - 3\%, p {$<$} .01) were higher with metformin than with placebo. Postexercise, metformin slightly lowered fat oxidation (0.12 + or - 0.02 to 0.10 + or - 0.02 g/min, p {$<$} .01) compared with placebo. There was an inverse relationship between postexercise fat oxidation and the rate of fat oxidation during exercise (r = -.68, p {$<$} .05). In healthy individuals, metformin has opposing actions on fat oxidation during and after exercise. Whether the same effects are evident in insulin-resistant individuals remains to be determined.},

After the serum concentration had become elevated, it could be restored to normal by feeding 1 gm. of dl-methionine but only partially restored by 0.5 gm. of l-cystine daily. The vascular lesions were in the ascending aorta but extended from the valves of the left ventricle to the proximal portions of the carotid and femoral arteries. Minimal lesions have been observed in the coronary arteries. The aortic lesions were chiefly characterized by the presence of lipid-laden phagocytes and increase in collagen and elastic fibers.

Lipid Res. 27, 465\textendash 474, 1986). We hypothesized that this was due, in part, to a decreased reactivity of low density lipoproteins (LDL) with arterial proteoglycans (PG). To test this hypothesis, cynomolgus monkeys were fed diets containing lard, safflower oil (n-6 polyunsaturated; Poly), menhanden fish oil (FO), or oleic acid-rich safflower oil (oleinate; Mono) for 14 mon, and plasma LDL were isolated and characterized. Several properties of LDL thought to be important in the interaction of LDL with arterial PG were measured including LDL particle size, chemical composition, sialic acid content, density distribution, apolipoprotein E (apoE) content and cholesteryl ester transition temperature. Plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations (mg/dL) after 14 mon of diet consumption averaged (mean{$\pm$}SEM): FO (366{$\pm$}45), Lard (352{$\pm$}27), Poly (279{$\pm$}24), and Mono (230{$\pm$}43).

The FO group had a lower proportion (13\%) of the apoE enriched d=1.015\textendash 1.025 g/mL subfraction of LDL than did the other diet groups (31\textendash 45\%). The transition temperature of the LDL cholesteryl esters was below body temperature for the FO and Poly groups (36\textdegree C) and above for the Lard and Mono groups (40\textendash 44\textdegree C). The percentage of LDL cholesterol that formed insoluble complexes with arterial chondroitin sulfate PG averaged: Mono (29{$\pm$}4\%), Lard (18{$\pm$}3\%), Poly (14{$\pm$}3\%), and FO (7{$\pm$}2\%). Among all diet groups, there was a significant positive correlation (r=0.54) between LDL-PG complex formation and LDL apoE/B molar ratio. We conclude that dietary FO and Poly result in LDL that are less reactive with arterial PG compared to Lard or Mono fats. While FO appears to decrease PG binding by decreasing the apoE content and amount of the largest LDL subfraction, Poly fat appears to affect LDL-PG interactions by other mechanisms. Decreased LDL-PG interactions may lead to decreased atherosclerosis in animals fed polyunsaturated dietary fat.},

  abstract = {Background Cardiovascular disease such as coronary artery disease, stroke and congestive heart failure, is a leading cause of death worldwide. A postulated risk factor is elevated circulating total homocysteine (tHcy) levels which is influenced mainly by blood levels of cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12), folic acid (vitamin B9) and pyridoxine (vitamin B6). There is uncertainty regarding the strength of association between tHcy and the risk of cardiovascular disease. Objectives To assess the clinical effectiveness of homocysteine-lowering interventions (HLI) in people with or without pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on The Cochrane Library (issue 3 2008), MEDLINE (1950 to August 2008), EMBASE (1988 to August 2008), and LILACS (1982 to September 2, 2008). We also searched in Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED; 1985 to August 2008), ISI Web of Science (1993 to August 2008), and the Cochrane Stroke Group Specialised Register (April 2007). We hand searched pertinent journals and the reference lists of included papers. We also contacted researchers in the field. There was no language restriction in the search. Selection criteria We included randomised clinical trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of HLI for preventing cardiovascular events with a follow-up period of 1 year or longer. We considered myocardial infarction and stroke as the primary outcomes. We excluded studies in patients with end-stage renal disease. Data collection and analysis We independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. We estimated relative risks (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. We measured statistical heterogeneity using I2. We used a random-effects model to synthesise the findings. Main results We included eight RCTs involving 24,210 participants with a low risk of bias in general terms. HLI did not reduce the risk of non-fatal or fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or death by any cause (pooled RR 1.03, 95\% CI 0.94 to 1.13, I2 = 0\%; pooled RR 0.89, 95\% CI 0.73 to 1.08, I2 = 15\%); and pooled RR 1.00 (95\% CI 0.92 to 1.09, I2: 0\%), respectively. Authors' conclusions Results from available published trials suggest that there is no evidence to support the use of HLI to prevent cardiovascular events.},

Obese adults were randomly assigned to a LCD (n = 134) or a LFD (n = 136) for 2 years. Cravings for specific types of foods (sweets, high-fats, fast-food fats, and carbohydrates/starches); preferences for high-sugar, high-carbohydrate, and low-carbohydrate/high-protein foods; and appetite were measured during the trial and evaluated during this secondary analysis of trial data. Differences between the LCD and LFD on change in outcome variables were examined with mixed linear models. Compared to the LFD, the LCD had significantly larger decreases in cravings for carbohydrates/starches and preferences for high-carbohydrate and high-sugar foods. The LCD group reported being less bothered by hunger compared to the LFD group. Compared to the LCD group, the LFD group had significantly larger decreases in cravings for high-fat foods and preference for low-carbohydrate/high-protein foods. Men had larger decreases in appetite ratings compared to women. Prescription of diets that promoted restriction of specific types of foods resulted in decreased cravings and preferences for the foods that were targeted for restriction. The results also indicate that the LCD group was less bothered by hunger compared to the LFD group and that men had larger reductions in appetite compared to women.},

  abstract = {Understanding the relationship between acute type A aortic dissection and sport is crucial to prevent sudden cardiac death in seemingly healthy young individuals. Aerobic exercise produces only a modest rise in arterial blood pressure (140-160 mmHg) except at the highest levels of exertion, at which pressures between 180-220 mmHg are reached. Weight training, on the other hand, routinely produces acute rises in blood pressure to over 300 mmHg. This presents a danger for individuals with an unknown aortic aneurysm; the deteriorated mechanical properties of the aortic wall resulting from aneurysmal enlargement increase the susceptibility to aortic rupture when the high wall coincident with exertion exceeds the tensile strength of the aortic wall. Investigations by our group into the inciting events leading up to dissection have demonstrated a causal link between extreme exertion, severe emotional stress, and acute type A aortic dissection. Since aortic enlargement is often unknown to persons participating in weight training, especially in the youth population, a \`iSnapShot Echocardiogram\^i screening program is been proposed; such a pilot program will raise awareness of the importance of pre-participation cardiac screening and allow for early detection of aneurysms as a means of preventing this \`isilent killer\^i from striking. As strong supporters of the numerous benefits of weight training, we encourage this activity in individuals without aneurysm; without aneurysm, wall tension does not reach dangerous levels, even at extremes of exertion. For individuals with known aortic dilatation, we recommend a program that limits their lifting to 50\% of body weight in the bench press or equivalent level of perceived exertion for other specific strength exercises.},

  abstract = {In mid-20th century United States, deaths from vascular disease reached a peak incidence in 1955, but little was known about the underlying causes of this epidemic of disease. The significance of homocysteine in human disease was unknown until 1962, when cases of homocystinuria were first associated with vascular disease. Analysis of an archival case of homocystinuria from 1933 and a case of cobalamin C disease from 1968 led to the conclusion that homocysteine causes vascular disease by a direct effect of the amino acid on arterial cells and tissues. The homocysteine theory of arteriosclerosis attributes one of the underlying causes of vascular disease to elevation of blood homocysteine concentrations as the result of dietary, genetic, metabolic, hormonal, or toxic factors. Dietary deficiency of vitamin B-6 and folic acid and absorptive deficiency of vitamin B-12, which result from traditional food processing or abnormal absorption of B vitamins, are important factors in causing elevations in blood homocysteine. Numerous clinical and epidemiologic studies have established elevated blood homocysteine as a potent independent risk factor for vascular disease in the general population. Dietary improvement, providing abundant vitamin B-6, folic acid, and cobalamin, may prevent vascular disease by lowering blood homocysteine. The dramatic decline in cardiovascular mortality in the United States since 1950 may possibly be attributable in part to voluntary fortification of the food supply with vitamin B-6 and folic acid. Fortification of the US food supply with folic acid in 1998, as mandated by the US Food and Drug Administration, was associated with a further decline in mortality from vascular disease, presumably because of increased blood folate and decreased blood homocysteine in the population.},

The method was then applied in 150 hyperlipidemic male out-patients, ingesting a standardized diet containing 250mg cholesterol per day, who had been randomized into four different drug-treatment groups: 1) no medication, 2) clofibrate, (2g/day), 3) cholestyramine (16g/day), or 4) both clofibrate and cholestyramine. Cholesterol absorption (as percent of the oral dose) was increased in patients receiving cholestyramine (P {$<$} 0.02) and decreased in those receiving clofibrate (P {$<$} 0.02); the group on the combined medication had the same pecent absorption as the control group. In twelve patients receiving cholestyramine, a second test of cholesterol absorption was performed 30 min after each patient had received 8g of cholestyramine. The pre-test administration of cholestyramine caused a 38\% decrease in cholesterol absorption (P {$<$} 0.001), compared to results obtained when medication was withheld prior to testing. These results demonstrate that the isotope-ratio method of measuring cholesterol absorption is a reproducible procedure applicable to a free-living out-patient population, and that the hypolipidemic drugs, clofibrate and cholestyramine, significantly affect cholesterol absorption in man.

Although anaphylaxis may occur after any vaccine, understanding the risk for this outcome, particularly following influenza vaccines, is important because of the large number of persons vaccinated annually. Recent Findings Two recent CDC safety studies confirmed the rarity of post-vaccination anaphylaxis. In a 25-year review of data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), reports in children were most common following childhood vaccinations and among adults more often followed influenza vaccine. In a Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) study, the estimated incidence of anaphylaxis was 1.3 per million vaccine doses administered for all vaccines and 1.6 per million doses for IIV3 (trivalent) influenza vaccine. Summary: Despite its rarity, its rapid onset (usually within minutes) and potentially lethal nature require that all personnel and facilities providing vaccinations have procedures in place for anaphylaxis management.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a frequent genetic disorder in Europe, affecting one in 500 people in its heterozygous form. Both homozygous and heterozygous forms are correlated with increased incidence of cardiovascular events. METHODS: We investigated clinical and biochemical parameters possibly associated with the results of exercise testing (ET) in asymptomatic patients with heterozygous FH. The study population was derived from outpatients of the Lipid Center in our department and consisted of 194 patients with heterozygous FH who had no medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) or angina-like symptoms and who had agreed to undergo ET. RESULTS: Sex, body mass index, smoking status, diabetes mellitus, family history of CAD, presence of xanthomas and total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoproteins A and B and lipoprotein (a) levels did not differ significantly between patients with positive and negative ET. Higher fibrinogen levels, arterial hypertension and family history of CAD were more frequent among patients with positive ET. However, in multivariate analysis adjusted for all the aforementioned variables, only high fibrinogen levels were significantly and independently associated with a positive result of ET. CONCLUSIONS: Lipid and coronary risk factor profiles do not seem to predict exercise-induced myocardial ischaemia in asymptomatic patients with heterozygous FH. However, in this high-risk population for cardiovascular events, fibrinogen levels are an independent predictor of positive ET. The adverse effects of FH on the cardiovascular system may be partly mediated by coagulability factors, whose role in the management of FH patients remains to be fully clarified.},

  abstract = {Aging is considered a significant risk factor for diabetes, and over the next decade, the largest increase in diabetes prevalence is expected to be in older adults. Our study aimed to investigate the challenges in managing type 2 diabetes in older adults and its multifactorial components that affect diabetes goal setting. ``My Diabetes GOAL'' hypothesized that a nursing intervention, along with a collaborative approach to management, education, and care, can engage older patients in personalized goal setting and address barriers to quality of life. A total of 88 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were included in this 6-month randomized controlled trial, with 42 patients enrolled in the intervention arm and 46 patients in the delayed-start control arm. Patients were required to complete a survey delivered through the patient portal to initiate personalized goal setting and care management support. Patients in the intervention arm received their first telephonic care management call by a study team nurse within five business days of the initial survey completion. The nurse discussed survey responses, barriers, and concerns the patient may have involving their care. Barriers included hypoglycemia, medication, co-morbidity, and physical activity. For this abstract, we report the frequency of care management topics for all 88 patients. The majority of our patient population identified as African American (68\%) and female (68\%). The average A1c at baseline was 7 \%. For every monthly call, A1c goal setting and education was a required discussion topic and did not vary significantly throughout the intervention (73\% month one, 74\% month six). During the first call, hypoglycemia was addressed among 56\% of participants, and education on medication was provided to 64\%. Co-morbidities (heart failure, incontinence, depression, chronic pain, falls, lung conditions, malignancies) were highly prevalent, with 68\% having one or more. Physical activity was discussed in 42\% of conversations with participants, and a referral (diabetes education, physical therapy) was needed by 25\%. After six months, discussions regarding hypoglycemia (14\%), medication (19\%), co-morbidities (56\%), physical activity (22\%), and referrals (6\%) were reduced. These results suggest that personalized telephonic care management for older adults can positively impact patient outcomes. Diabetes care management is not a one size fits all. Personalized goal setting was successfully discussed based on an individual's risk factor, which took into consideration co-morbidities and physical mobility barriers. Future studies should evaluate long-term clinical outcomes with a randomized control design.},

These differences are attributed to differences in cultural norms, mitigation efforts, and health infrastructure. Here we propose that national differences in COVID19 impact could be partially explained by the different national policies respect to Bacillus Calmette-Gu\'erin (BCG) childhood vaccination. BCG vaccination has been reported to offer broad protection to respiratory infections. We compared large number of countries BCG vaccination policies with the morbidity and mortality for COVID-19. We found that countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, Nederland, USA) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies. Countries that have a late start of universal BCG policy (Iran, 1984) had high mortality, consistent with the idea that BCG protects the vaccinated elderly population. We also found that BCG vaccination also reduced the number of reported COVID-19 cases in a country. The combination of reduced morbidity and mortality makes BCG vaccination a potential new tool in the fight against COVID-19.},

Methods We retrospectively report on 1061 SARS-CoV-2 positive tested patients treated for at least three days with the following regimen: HCQ (200~mg three times daily for ten days)~+~AZ (500~mg on day 1 followed by 250~mg daily for the next four days). Outcomes were death, clinical worsening (transfer to ICU, and {$>$}10 day hospitalization) and viral shedding persistence ({$>$}10 days). Results A total of 1061 patients were included in this analysis (46.4\% male, mean age 43.6 years \textendash{} range 14\textendash 95 years). Good clinical outcome and virological cure were obtained in 973 patients within 10 days (91.7\%). Prolonged viral carriage was observed in 47 patients (4.4\%) and was associated to a higher viral load at diagnosis (p~{$<~$}.001) but viral culture was negative at day 10. All but one, were PCR-cleared at day 15. A poor clinical outcome (PClinO) was observed for 46 patients (4.3\%) and 8 died (0.75\%) (74\textendash 95 years old). All deaths resulted from respiratory failure and not from cardiac toxicity. Five patients are still hospitalized (98.7\% of patients cured so far). PClinO was associated with older age (OR 1.11), severity of illness at admission (OR 10.05) and low HCQ serum concentration. PClinO was independently associated with the use of selective beta-blocking agents and angiotensin II receptor blockers (p~{$<~$}.05). A total of 2.3\% of patients reported mild adverse events (gastrointestinal or skin symptoms, headache, insomnia and transient blurred vision). Conclusion Administration of the HCQ+AZ combination before COVID-19 complications occur is safe and associated with a very low fatality rate in patients.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This study investigated the effect of {$\beta$}-blockade on physiological and perceived exertion (RPE) responses during incremental treadmill exercise. METHODS: Sixteen healthy participants (n = 8 men; age, 25.3 {$\pm$} 4.6 yr) performed a maximal treadmill exercise test after ingestion of 100 mg metoprolol or placebo, with a double-blind, randomized, and counterbalanced design. Heart rate (HR), ventilatory, and gas exchange variables were measured continuously, and participants reported RPE at the end of each minute. Physiological and RPE responses during each condition were compared at the ventilatory threshold (VT), respiratory compensation point, and at maximal exercise using repeated-measures ANOVA. Linear regression modeled relationships between perceived exertion and physiological variables. RESULTS: The HR and V\textperiodcentered O2 at the VT, respiratory compensation point, and maximal exercise were all significantly lower after {$\beta$}-blockade (P {$<$} 0.05). However, when standardized to within condition peak values, differences were no longer significant. The RPE associated with VT was higher after {$\beta$}-blockade (12.9 {$\pm$} 1.0 vs 12.3 {$\pm$} 1.2, P {$<$} 0.05) but lower at maximal exercise (19.1 {$\pm$} 0.6 vs 19.4 {$\pm$} 0.5, P {$<$} 0.05). Increases in RPE relative to HR were greater after {$\beta$}-blockade and remained significant when expressed relative to peak HR. There was no difference in the growth of the relationship between RPE and V\textperiodcentered O2 across conditions, although the origin of the relationship was higher with {$\beta$}-blockade. CONCLUSIONS: Although {$\beta$}-blockade resulted in a significant reduction in exercising HR and V\textperiodcentered O2, the RPE for a given relative intensity remained unchanged. The relationship between RPE and V\textperiodcentered O2 was not affected by {$\beta$}-blockade. The results provide evidence that RPE is a useful and reliable measure for exercise testing and prescription in patients prescribed {$\beta$}-blockade therapy.},

However, the relative impact of statins on ASCVD outcomes stratified by CAC scores is unknown. Objectives The authors sought to determine whether CAC can identify patients most likely to benefit from statin treatment. Methods The authors identified consecutive subjects without pre-existing ASCVD or malignancy who underwent CAC scoring from 2002 to 2009 at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. The primary outcome was first major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), a composite of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death. The effect of statin therapy on outcomes was analyzed stratified by CAC presence and severity, after adjusting for baseline comorbidities with inverse probability of treatment weights based on propensity scores. Results A total of 13,644 patients (mean age 50 years; 71\% men) were followed for a median of 9.4 years. Comparing patients with and without statin exposure, statin therapy was associated with reduced risk of MACE in patients with CAC (adjusted subhazard ratio: 0.76; 95\% confidence interval: 0.60 to 0.95; p = 0.015), but not in patients without CAC (adjusted subhazard ratio: 1.00; 95\% confidence interval: 0.79 to 1.27; p = 0.99). The effect of statin use on MACE was significantly related to the severity of CAC (p {$<$} 0.0001 for interaction), with the number needed to treat to prevent 1 initial MACE outcome over 10 years ranging from 100 (CAC 1 to 100) to 12 (CAC {$>$}100). Conclusions In a largescale cohort without baseline ASCVD, the presence and severity of CAC identified patients most likely to benefit from statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases.},

  abstract = {Background Current strategies for preventing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections are limited to non-pharmacological interventions. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been proposed as a postexposure therapy to prevent Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) but definitive evidence is lacking. Methods We conducted an open-label, cluster-randomized trial including asymptomatic contacts exposed to a PCR-positive Covid-19 case in Catalonia, Spain. Clusters were randomized to receive no specific therapy (control arm) or HCQ 800mg once, followed by 400mg daily for 6 days (intervention arm). The primary outcome was PCR-confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 within 14 days. The secondary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection, either symptomatically compatible or a PCR-positive result regardless of symptoms. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed up to 28 days. Results The analysis included 2,314 healthy contacts of 672 Covid-19 index cases identified between Mar 17 and Apr 28, 2020. A total of 1,198 were randomly allocated to usual care and 1,116 to HCQ therapy. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 disease (6.2\% usual care vs. 5.7\% HCQ; risk ratio 0.89 [95\% confidence interval 0.54-1.46]), nor evidence of beneficial effects on prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (17.8\% usual care vs. 18.7\% HCQ). The incidence of AEs was higher in the intervention arm than in the control arm (5.9\% usual care vs 51.6\% HCQ), but no treatment-related serious AEs were reported. Conclusions Postexposure therapy with HCQ did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 disease and infection in healthy individuals exposed to a PCR-positive case. Our findings do not support HCQ as postexposure prophylaxis for Covid-19.},

Palmitate and glycerol kinetics and substrate oxidation were assessed during 90 min of cycling at 50\% peak aerobic capacity ({\.V}o2 peak) by use of stable isotope-labeled tracer infusion and indirect calorimetry. An inverse relationship was found between \%body fat and exercise-induced increase in glycerol appearance rate relative to fat mass (r2 = 0.74; P {$<$} 0.01). The increase in total fatty acid uptake during exercise [({$\mu$}mol/kg fat-free mass) \texttimes{} 90 min] was {$\sim$}50\% smaller in obese (181 {$\pm$} 70; P {$<$} 0.05) and {$\sim$}35\% smaller in overweight (230 {$\pm$} 71; P {$<$} 0.05) than in lean (354 {$\pm$} 34) men. The percentage of total fatty acid oxidation derived from systemic plasma fatty acids decreased with increasing body fat, from 49 {$\pm$} 3\% in lean to 39 {$\pm$} 4\% in obese men (P {$<$} 0.05); conversely, the percentage of nonsystemic fatty acids, presumably derived from intramuscular and possibly plasma triglycerides, increased with increasing body fat (P {$<$} 0.05). We conclude that the lipolytic response to exercise decreases with increasing adiposity. The blunted increase in lipolytic rate in overweight and obese men compared with lean men limits the availability of plasma fatty acids as a fuel during exercise. However, the rate of total fat oxidation was similar in all groups because of a compensatory increase in the oxidation of nonsystemic fatty acids.},

Its main natural sources in foods are vegetables such as onions, the most studied quercetin containing foods, and broccoli; fruits (apples, berry crops, and grapes); some herbs; tea; and wine. Quercetin is known for its antioxidant activity in radical scavenging and anti-allergic properties characterized by stimulation of immune system, antiviral activity, inhibition of histamine release, decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines, leukotrienes creation, and suppresses interleukin IL-4 production. It can improve the Th1/Th2 balance, and restrain antigen-specific IgE antibody formation. It is also effective in the inhibition of enzymes such as lipoxygenase, eosinophil and peroxidase and the suppression of inflammatory mediators. All mentioned mechanisms of action contribute to the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties of quercetin that can be effectively utilized in treatment of late-phase, and late-late-phase bronchial asthma responses, allergic rhinitis and restricted peanut-induced anaphylactic reactions. Plant extract of quercetin is the main ingredient of many potential anti-allergic drugs, supplements and enriched products, which is more competent in inhibiting of IL-8 than cromolyn (anti-allergic drug disodium cromoglycate) and suppresses IL-6 and cytosolic calcium level increase.},

Since standard medications usually fail to reduce LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels satisfactorily, LDL-apheresis is a mainstay of managing HoFH patients but, at the same time, very burdensome and sub-optimally effective. Liver transplantation (LT) has been previously shown to be a promising alternative. We report on a 14-year-long follow-up after LT in a HoFH patient.. At the age of four, the patient was referred to our institution because of the gradually increasing number of xanthomas on the knees, elbows, buttocks, and later the homozygous mutation c.1754T\&gt;C (p.Ile585Thr) on the LDL-receptor gene was confirmed. Despite subsequent intensive treatment with the combination of diet, statins, bile acid sequestrant, probucol, and LDL-apheresis, the patient developed valvular aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation by 12 years. At 16 years, the patient successfully underwent deceased-donor orthotopic LT. Nine years post-LT, we found total regression of the cutaneous xanthomas and atherosclerotic plaques, and with normal endothelial function. Fourteen years post-LT, his clinical condition remained stable, but LDL-C levels have progressively risen. Also, a systematic review of the literature and guidelines on the LT for HoFH patients was performed. Six of the 17 identified guidelines did not take LT as a treatment option in consideration at all. But still the majority of guidelines suggest LT as an exceptional therapeutic option or as the last resort option when all the other treatment options are inadequate or not tolerated. Most of observed patients had some kind of Cardiovascular disease before the LT. In 76 \% of LT the cardiovascular burden did not progress after LT. Most of the follow-up data were short-termed, only a few case reports have followed patients for ten or more years after LT. LT is a feasible therapeutic option for HoFH patients, reversing atherosclerotic changes uncontrollable by conservative therapy, thus importantly improving the HoFH patient's prognosis and quality of life. LDL-C levels might be increasing over time post-LT.},

We analyzed sex-specific outcomes in the Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) and synthesized the results with prior trials. METHODS AND RESULTS: JUPITER participants included 6801 women {$>$} or =60 years of age and 11 001 men {$>$} or =50 years of age with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein {$>$} or =2 mg/L and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol {$<$}130 mg/dL randomized to rosuvastatin versus placebo. Meta-analysis studies were randomized placebo-controlled statin trials with predominantly or exclusively primary prevention in women and sex-specific outcomes (20 147 women; {$>$}276 CVD events; mean age, 63 to 69 years). Absolute CVD rates (per 100 person-years) in JUPITER women for rosuvastatin and placebo (0.57 and 1.04, respectively) were lower than for men (0.88 and 1.54, respectively), with similar relative risk reduction in women (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95\% confidence interval, 0.37 to 0.80; P=0.002) and men (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95\% confidence interval, 0.45 to 0.73; P{$<$}0.001). In women, there was significant reduction in revascularization/unstable angina and nonsignificant reductions in other components of the primary end point. Meta-analysis of 13 154 women (240 CVD events; 216 total deaths) from exclusively primary prevention trials found a significant reduction in primary CVD events with statins by a third (relative risk, 0.63; 95\% confidence interval, 0.49 to 0.82; P{$<$}0.001; P for heterogeneity=0.56) with a smaller nonsignificant effect on total mortality (relative risk, 0.78; 95\% confidence interval, 0.53 to 1.15; P=0.21; P for heterogeneity=0.20). Similar results were obtained for trials that were predominantly but not exclusively primary prevention. CONCLUSIONS: JUPITER demonstrated that in primary prevention rosuvastatin reduced CVD events in women with a relative risk reduction similar to that in men, a finding supported by meta-analysis of primary prevention statin trials.

  abstract = {Atherosclerosis burden and coronary artery calcium (CAC) are associated with the risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events, with absence of plaque and CAC indicating low risk. Whether this is true in patients with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is not known. Specifically, a high prevalence of noncalcified plaque might signal high risk.To determine the prevalence of noncalcified and calcified plaque in symptomatic adults and assess its association with cardiovascular events across the LDL-C spectrum.This cohort study included symptomatic patients undergoing coronary computed tomographic angiography from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2017, from the seminational Western Denmark Heart Registry. Follow-up was completed on July 6, 2018. Data were analyzed from April 2 to December 2, 2021.Prevalence of calcified and noncalcified plaque according to LDL-C strata of less than 77, 77 to 112, 113 to 154, 155 to 189, and at least 190 mg/dL. Severity of coronary artery disease was categorized using CAC scores of 0, 1 to 99, and {$\geq$}100, where higher numbers indicate greater CAC burden.Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events (myocardial infarction and stroke) and death.A total of 23\,143 patients with a median age of 58 (IQR, 50-65) years (12 857 [55.6\%] women) were included in the analysis. During median follow-up of 4.2 (IQR, 2.3-6.1) years, 1029 ASCVD and death events occurred. Across all LDL-C strata, absence of CAC was a prevalent finding (ranging from 438 of 948 [46.2\%] in patients with LDL-C levels of at least 190 mg/dL to 4370 of 7964 [54.9\%] in patients with LDL-C levels of 77-112 mg/dL) and associated with no detectable plaque in most patients, ranging from 338 of 438 (77.2\%) in those with LDL-C levels of at least 190 mg/dL to 1067 of 1204 (88.6\%) in those with LDL-C levels of less than 77 mg/dL. In all LDL-C groups, absence of CAC was associated with low rates of ASCVD and death (6.3 [95\% CI, 5.6-7.0] per 1000 person-years), with increasing rates in patients with CAC scores of 1 to 99 (11.1 [95\% CI, 10.0-12.5] per 1000 person-years) and CAC scores of at least 100 (21.9 [95\% CI, 19.9-24.4] per 1000 person-years). Among those with CAC scores of\,0, the event rate per 1000 person-years was 6.3 (95\% CI, 5.6-7.0) in the overall population compared with 6.9 (95\% CI, 4.0-11.9) in those with LDL-C levels of at least 190 mg/dL. Across all LDL-C strata, rates were similar and low in those with CAC\,scores of 0, regardless of whether they had no plaque or purely noncalcified plaque.The findings of this cohort study suggest that in symptomatic patients with severely elevated LDL-C levels of at least 190 mg/dL who are universally considered to be at high risk by guidelines, absence of calcified and noncalcified plaque on coronary computed tomographic angiography was associated with low risk for ASCVD events. These results further suggest that atherosclerosis burden, including CAC, can be used to individualize treatment intensity in patients with severely elevated LDL-C levels.}

The MT occurs over time and is characterized by clinically defined stages with specific neurological symptoms. Yet, little is known of how this process impacts the human brain. This multi-modality neuroimaging study indicates substantial differences in brain structure, connectivity, and energy metabolism across MT stages (pre-menopause, peri-menopause, and post-menopause). These effects involved brain regions subserving higher-order cognitive processes and were specific to menopausal endocrine aging rather than chronological aging, as determined by comparison to age-matched males. Brain biomarkers largely stabilized post-menopause, and gray matter volume (GMV) recovered in key brain regions for cognitive aging. Notably, GMV recovery and in vivo brain mitochondria ATP production correlated with preservation of cognitive performance post-menopause, suggesting adaptive compensatory processes. In parallel to the adaptive process, amyloid-{$\beta$} deposition was more pronounced in peri-menopausal and post-menopausal women carrying apolipoprotein E-4 (APOE-4) genotype, the major genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, relative to genotype-matched males. These data show that human menopause is a dynamic neurological transition that significantly impacts brain structure, connectivity, and metabolic profile during midlife endocrine aging of the female brain.},

  abstract = {Background Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic progressive disease. During the course of the disease intensive treatment is often necessary resulting in multiple interventions including administration of insulin. Although dietary intervention is highly recommended, the clinical results of the widely prescribed diets with low fat content and high carbohydrates are disappointing. In this proof-of-concept study, we tested the effect of dietary carbohydrate-restriction in conjunction with metformin and liraglutide on metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods Forty patients with type 2 diabetes already being treated with two oral anti-diabetic drugs or insulin treatment and who showed deterioration of their glucose metabolism (i.e. HbA1c {$>$}7.5), were treated. A carbohydrate-restricted diet and a combination of metformin and liraglutide were instituted, after stopping either insulin or oral anti-diabetic drugs (excluding metformin). After enrollment, the study patients were scheduled for follow-up visits at one, two, three and six months. Primary outcome was glycemic control, measured by HbA1c at six months. Secondary outcomes were body weight, lipid-profile and treatment satisfaction. Results Thirty-five (88\%) participants completed the study. Nearly all participating patients experienced a drop in HbA1c and body weight during the first three months, an effect which was maintained until the end of the study at six months. Seventy-one percent of the patients reached HbA1c values below 7.0\%. The range of body weight at enrollment was extreme, reaching 165 kg as the highest initial value. The average weight loss after 6 months was 10\%. Most patients were satisfied with this treatment. During the intervention no significant change of lipids was observed. Most patients who were on insulin could maintain the treatment without insulin with far better metabolic control. Conclusions Carbohydrate restriction in conjunction with metformin and liraglutide is an effective treatment option for patients with advanced diabetes who are candidates for instituting insulin or who are in need of intensified insulin treatment. This proof-of-principle study showed a significant treatment effect on metabolic control.},

This article provides an updated American Heart Association scientific statement on BP measurement in humans. In the office setting, many oscillometric devices have been validated that allow accurate BP measurement while reducing human errors associated with the auscultatory approach. Fully automated oscillometric devices capable of taking multiple readings even without an observer being present may provide a more accurate measurement of BP than auscultation. Studies have shown substantial differences in BP when measured outside versus in the office setting. Ambulatory BP monitoring is considered the reference standard for out-of-office BP assessment, with home BP monitoring being an alternative when ambulatory BP monitoring is not available or tolerated. Compared with their counterparts with sustained normotension (ie, nonhypertensive BP levels in and outside the office setting), it is unclear whether adults with white-coat hypertension (ie, hypertensive BP levels in the office but not outside the office) have increased cardiovascular disease risk, whereas those with masked hypertension (ie, hypertensive BP levels outside the office but not in the office) are at substantially increased risk. In addition, high nighttime BP on ambulatory BP monitoring is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. Both oscillometric and auscultatory methods are considered acceptable for measuring BP in children and adolescents. Regardless of the method used to measure BP, initial and ongoing training of technicians and healthcare providers and the use of validated and calibrated devices are critical for obtaining accurate BP measurements.},

However, the effects of prolonged energy deficits on resistance training (RT) outcomes remain unexplored. Thus, we conducted a systematic review of PubMed and SportDiscus for randomized controlled trials performing RT in an energy deficit (RT+ED) for {$\geq$}3 weeks. We first divided the literature into studies with a parallel control group without an energy deficit (RT+CON; Analysis A) and studies without RT+CON (Analysis B). Analysis A consisted of a meta-analysis comparing gains in lean mass (LM) and strength between RT+ED and RT+CON. Studies in Analysis B were matched with separate RT+CON studies for participant and intervention characteristics, and we qualitatively compared the gains in LM and strength between RT+ED and RT+CON. Finally, Analyses A and B were pooled into a meta-regression examining the relationship between the magnitude of the energy deficit and LM. Analysis A showed LM gains were impaired in RT+ED vs RT+CON (effect size (ES) = -0.57, p = 0.02), but strength gains were comparable between conditions (ES = -0.31, p = 0.28). Analysis B supports the impairment of LM in RT+ED (ES: -0.11, p = 0.03) vs RT+CON (ES: 0.20, p {$<$} 0.001) but not strength (RT+ED ES: 0.84; RT+CON ES: 0.81).

  abstract = {Studies with animal models suggest that saturated fatty acids raise low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels by reducing LDL receptor- mediated clearance. To examine this directly in humans, we studied the effects of lowering dietary saturated fat on LDL-receptor abundance in peripheral mononuclear cells which reflects hepatic LDL-receptor status. Healthy males and females (n = 25) participating in the DELTA (Dietary Effects on Lipoproteins and Thrombogenic Activity) Study consumed three experimental diets in a randomized cross-over design. Diets provided 34\% fat, 15\% saturated fatty acids (Average American Diet); 29\% fat, 9\% saturated fatty acids (Step-One Diet); and 25\% fat, and 6\% saturated fatty acids (Low SAT Diet). Peripheral mononuclear cells were isolated from blood samples collected after 6 and 8 wk. An ELISA was used to quantify LDL-receptor protein in total cell membranes. LDL-receptor abundance increased by 10.5\% after the Low SAT Diet (P {$<$} 0.05). This was associated with an 11.8\% decrease in serum LDL-cholesterol (P {$<$} 0.05). A linear inverse relationship was observed between the percentage change in LDL-cholesterol and the percentage change in LDL-receptor abundance (r = -0.59; P {$<$} 0.01). In addition, LDL- receptor abundance also was correlated inversely (P {$<$} 0.001) with serum levels of LDL-cholesterol (r = -0.747) and apoB (r = =0.593). In summary, reducing dietary saturated fat is associated with an increase in LDL-receptor abundance of magnitude similar to the decrease in serum LDL-cholesterol. Thus, an important mechanism by which reductions in dietary saturated fatty acids decrease LDL-cholesterol in humans is through an increase in LDL- receptor number.}

Six of these had been diagnosed clinically as familial hypercholesterolemic (FH) heterozygotes. We have since examined low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor function in the FDB index patients and in three of their families. Skin fibroblasts from seven of seven unrelated FDB patients from whom cell lines were established exhibited normal high-affinity binding and degradation of normal LDL in vitro. In the three families, a raised plasma LDL concentration did not segregate with a haplotype of two polymorphic restriction sites at the LDL receptor locus. We conclude that the clinical and biochemical signs of classical FH can occur in the presence of the FDB mutation and a normal LDL receptor gene. In a four-generation family with 11 proven or presumed FDB heterozygotes, expression of the mutation ranged from normal plasma LDL concentrations and no clinical signs in two individuals, to hypercholesterolemia and death from myocardial infarction at age 31. Variable expression of the FDB mutation could not be explained conclusively by variation in diet, body mass index, smoking habit, apo E genotype, or plasma Lp(a) concentration.},

  abstract = {Sleep is the most important period for recovery from daily load. Regular physical activity enhances overall sleep quality, but the effects of acute exercise on sleep are not well defined. In sleep hygiene recommendations, intensive exercising is not suggested within the last 3 h before bed time, but this recommendation has not been adequately tested experimentally. Therefore, the effects of vigorous late-night exercise on sleep were examined by measuring polysomnographic, actigraphic and subjective sleep quality, as well as cardiac autonomic activity. Eleven (seven men, four women) physically fit young adults (VO2max 54 {$\pm$} 8 mL{$\cdot$}kg-1{$\cdot$}min-1, age 26 {$\pm$} 3 years) were monitored in a sleep laboratory twice in a counterbalanced order: (1) after vigorous late-night exercise; and (2) after a control day without exercise. The incremental cycle ergometer exercise until voluntary exhaustion started at 21:00 {$\pm$} 00:28 hours, lasted for 35 {$\pm$} 3 min, and ended 2:13 {$\pm$} 00:19 hours before bed time. The proportion of non-rapid eye movement sleep was greater after the exercise day than the control day (P {$<$} 0.01), while no differences were seen in actigraphic or subjective sleep quality. During the whole sleep, no differences were found in heart rate (HR) variability, whereas HR was higher after the exercise day than the control day (54 {$\pm$} 7 versus 51 {$\pm$} 7, P {$<$} 0.01), and especially during the first three sleeping hours. The results indicate that vigorous late-night exercise does not disturb sleep quality. However, it may have effects on cardiac autonomic control of heart during the first sleeping hours.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ezetimibe lowers plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by inhibiting the activity of the Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) protein. However, whether such inhibition reduces the risk of coronary heart disease is not known. Human mutations that inactivate a gene encoding a drug target can mimic the action of an inhibitory drug and thus can be used to infer potential effects of that drug. METHODS: We sequenced the exons of NPC1L1 in 7364 patients with coronary heart disease and in 14,728 controls without such disease who were of European, African, or South Asian ancestry. We identified carriers of inactivating mutations (nonsense, splice-site, or frameshift mutations). In addition, we genotyped a specific inactivating mutation (p.Arg406X) in 22,590 patients with coronary heart disease and in 68,412 controls. We tested the association between the presence of an inactivating mutation and both plasma lipid levels and the risk of coronary heart disease. RESULTS: With sequencing, we identified 15 distinct NPC1L1 inactivating mutations; approximately 1 in every 650 persons was a heterozygous carrier for 1 of these mutations. Heterozygous carriers of NPC1L1 inactivating mutations had a mean LDL cholesterol level that was 12 mg per deciliter (0.31 mmol per liter) lower than that in noncarriers (P=0.04). Carrier status was associated with a relative reduction of 53\% in the risk of coronary heart disease (odds ratio for carriers, 0.47; 95\% confidence interval, 0.25 to 0.87; P=0.008). In total, only 11 of 29,954 patients with coronary heart disease had an inactivating mutation (carrier frequency, 0.04\%) in contrast to 71 of 83,140 controls (carrier frequency, 0.09\%). CONCLUSIONS: Naturally occurring mutations that disrupt NPC1L1 function were found to be associated with reduced plasma LDL cholesterol levels and a reduced risk of coronary heart disease.

This test looks at DNA methylation patterns in patient blood samples to detect cancer and also predict cancer origin. The PATHFINDER study will include \textasciitilde 6200 study participants from 31 sites in the United States. The study will return tests results to participants and their health care providers and will evaluate how test results affect the clinical pathway to confirm or rule out a cancer diagnosis. Results of this study could help determine how a blood-based multi-cancer early detection test will fit into clinical practice. Abstract To examine the extent of the evaluation required to achieve diagnostic resolution and the test performance characteristics of a targeted methylation cell-free DNA (cfDNA)-based multi-cancer early detection (MCED) test, \textasciitilde 6200 participants {$\geq$}50 years with (cohort A) or without (cohort B) {$\geq$}1 of 3 additional specific cancer risk factors will be enrolled in PATHFINDER (NCT04241796), a prospective, longitudinal, interventional, multi-center study. Plasma cfDNA from blood samples will be analyzed to detect abnormally methylated DNA associated with cancer (i.e., cancer ``signal'') and a cancer signal origin (i.e., tissue of origin). Participants with a ``signal detected'' will undergo further diagnostic evaluation per guiding physician discretion; those with a ``signal not detected'' will be advised to continue guideline-recommended screening. The primary objective will be to assess the number and types of subsequent diagnostic tests needed for diagnostic resolution. Based on microsimulations (using estimates of cancer incidence and dwell times) of the typical risk profiles of anticipated participants, the median (95\% CI) number of participants with a ``signal detected'' result is expected to be 106 (87\textendash 128). Subsequent diagnostic evaluation is expected to detect 52 (39\textendash 67) cancers. The positive predictive value of the MCED test is expected to be 49\% (39\textendash 58\%). PATHFINDER will evaluate the integration of a cfDNA-based MCED test into existing clinical cancer diagnostic pathways. The study design of PATHFINDER is described here.},

We classified SPTs according to their blood flow pattern on Doppler ultrasound and re-evaluated the efficacy of this imaging modality as a screening method. Additionally, we combined Doppler ultrasound with several values to improve the diagnostic efficacy and to establish a new diagnostic tool. Patients and methods. This study included 189 cases of pathologically confirmed SPTs (122 cases of benign disease including SPTs and tumour-like lesions and 67 cases of malignant SPTs). Ultrasound imaging included evaluation of vascularity by colour Doppler. We established a scoring system to more effectively differentiate malignant from benign SPTs (ultrasound-based sarcoma screening [USS] score). Results. The mean scores in the benign and malignant groups were 1.47 {$\pm$} 0.93 and 3.42 {$\pm$} 1.30, respectively. Patients with malignant masses showed significantly higher USS scores than did those with benign masses (p {$<$} 1 \texttimes{} 10-10). The area under the curve was 0.88 by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Based on the cut-off value (3 points) calculated by ROC curve analysis, the sensitivity and specificity for a diagnosis of malignant SPT was 85.1\% and 86.9\%, respectively. Conclusions. Assessment of vascularity by Doppler ultrasound alone is insufficient for differentiation between benign and malignant SPTs. Preoperative diagnosis of most SPTs is possible by combining our USS score with characteristic clinical and magnetic resonance imaging findings.},

In this investigation, we have compared LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and remnant-like lipoprotein particles (RLP) as cardiovascular risk factors in SCD cases, especially in Pokkuri death syndrome (PDS) cases who had nearly normal coronary arteries. To predict the risk of plasma RLP-cholesterol, triglyceride (RLP-C, RLP-TG) and LDL-C in fatal clinical events associated with SCD cases with or without atherosclerosis (PDS), we calculated the cut-off values and likelihood ratio of these lipoproteins from ROC analysis. Sixty-eight percent of SCD cases were above cut-off value of RLP-C ({$>$}12.8 mg/dL) versus 32\% for control death cases (P{$<$}0.0001) and the likelihood ratio of RLP-C was 2.12. Significantly higher incidence of RLP-C above cut-off value ({$>$}10.1 mg/dL) was seen in PDS compared to controls (P{$<$}0.0001) and the likelihood ratio was 3.13. Similarly, significantly higher incidence of RLP-TG above cut-off values, SCD{$>$}53 mg/dL and PDS{$>$}67 mg/dL, was seen compared to controls (P{$<$}0.0001) and the likelihood ratio was 1.86 and 2.73, respectively. Further, significantly higher incidence of LDL-C above cut-off value ({$>$}93 mg/dL) was seen in SCD compared to controls (P{$<$}0.0001) and the likelihood ratio was 1.68. However, the incidence of LDL-C above cut-off value (LDL-C{$>$}106 mg/dL) was not significantly different between PDS and controls and the likelihood ratio was 1.52. In conclusion, this study has shown high levels of plasma remnant lipoproteins in PDS and that PDS cases did not present with atherosclerotic lesions or elevated LDL-C. In contrast, SCD cases showed high levels of plasma remnant lipoproteins together with elevated plasma LDL-C. Accordingly, we believe that plasma remnant lipoproteins level rather than plasma LDL-C is a major pathologic factor in cardiovascular events.},

In this review, we propose a hypothesis of the causal lipoproteins in atherosclerosis based on our recent findings on postprandial remnant lipoproteins (RLP). Plasma RLP-C and RLP-TG increased significantly after food intake, especially a fat load. More than 80\% of the TG increase after the fat load consisted of the TG in RLP, which contained significantly greater apoB100 than apoB48 particles as VLDL remnants. The majority of the LPL in non-heparin plasma was found in RLP as an RLP-LPL complex and released into the circulation after hydrolysis. Plasma LPL did not increase after food intake, which may have caused the partial hydrolysis of CM and VLDL as well as the significant increase of RLP-TG in the postprandial plasma. LPL was inversely correlated with the RLP particle size after food intake. We showed that VLDL remnants are the major atherogenic lipoproteins in the postprandial plasma associated with insufficient LPL activity and a causal factor in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. We also propose "LPL bound TG-rich lipoproteins" as a new definition of remnant lipoproteins based on the findings of the RLP-LPL complex in the non-heparin plasma.},

Therefore, it was believed that insulin resistance causes and enhances RLP formation. In contrast, this hypothesis states that RLP induces insulin resistance as the result of obesity associated with the excessive fat intake. The majority of plasma TG increased after fat intake is TG in RLP (RLP-TG) and the majority of postprandial RLP is VLDL remnants, not CM remnants. RLP is newly formed lipoproteins primarily for energy supply against starvation, like blood sugar after carbohydrate intake. Since RLP bearing apoE, LPL and Lp(a) function as ligands for the VLDL receptor, RLP interacts with the VLDL receptor in visceral fat adipocytes and stored as TG similar to excessive blood sugar. However, the excessive VLDL remnants induces obesity and its associated insulin resistance, which plays a major role as the initiator of metabolic domino effects, similar to blood sugar primarily serving as an energy supply to protect against starvation.},

This study examined the predictive value of remnant lipoprotein levels for cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) with LDL-C levels {$<$}100mg/dL on lipid-lowering therapy. METHODS: Serum levels of remnant lipoproteins (remnant-like lipoprotein particles cholesterol; RLP-C) were measured by an immunoseparation method in 560 patients with CAD who had LDL-C levels {$<$}100mg/dL on lipid-lowering therapy, including statin (58\%), fibrate (13\%) or diet only (29\%). All the patients were followed prospectively for a period of {$\leq$} 36 months or until occurrence of one of the following events: cardiac death, non fatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring coronary revascularization, or ischemic stroke. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up period of 33 months, 40 events occurred. Stepwise multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that RLP-C was a significant predictor of cardiovascular events after adjustment for known risk factors and lipid variables including triglycerides, non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-C, and total apolipoprotein B (HR 1.53, 95\% CI 1.35-1.97, p{$<$}0.01). The c-statistics showed that addition of RLP-C had a greater incremental effect on the predictive value of conventional risk factors than addition of non-HDL-C or total apolipoprotein B. CONCLUSIONS: RLP-C was superior to non-HDL-C for predicting cardiovascular events in CAD patients with LDL-C levels {$<$}100mg/dL on lipid-lowering treatment. Remnant lipoprotein may therefore be an important target for residual risk reduction after LDL-C goals on lipid lowering therapy.},

  abstract = {Background Caffeine is one of the most widely consumed pharmacologically active substances. Its acute effect on myocardial blood flow is widely unknown. Our aim was to assess the acute effect of caffeine in a dose corresponding to two cups of coffee on myocardial blood flow (MBF) in coronary artery disease (CAD). Methodology/Principal Findings MBF was measured with 15O-labelled H2O and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) at rest and after supine bicycle exercise in controls (n = 15, mean age 58{$\pm$}13 years) and in CAD patients (n = 15, mean age 61{$\pm$}9 years). In the latter, regional MBF was assessed in segments subtended by stenotic and remote coronary arteries. All measurements were repeated fifty minutes after oral caffeine ingestion (200 mg). Myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) was calculated as ratio of MBF during bicycle stress divided by MBF at rest. Resting MBF was not affected by caffeine in both groups. Exercise-induced MBF response decreased significantly after caffeine in controls (2.26{$\pm$}0.56 vs. 2.02{$\pm$}0.56, P{$<$}0.005), remote (2.40{$\pm$}0.70 vs. 1.78{$\pm$}0.46, P{$<$}0.001) and in stenotic segments (1.90{$\pm$}0.41 vs. 1.38{$\pm$}0.30, P{$<$}0.001). Caffeine decreased MPR significantly by 14\% in controls (P{$<$}0.05 vs. baseline). In CAD patients MPR decreased by 18\% (P{$<$}0.05 vs. baseline) in remote and by 25\% in stenotic segments (P{$<$}0.01 vs. baseline). Conclusions We conclude that caffeine impairs exercise-induced hyperaemic MBF response in patients with CAD to a greater degree than age-matched controls.},

  abstract = {Background: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming a significant problem especially through substantial increase in the incidence of obesity worldwide. Currently it is the most common cause of abnormal serum aminotransferase levels both in low- and middle-income countries and in high-income countries and despite its high prevalence, well-defined screening recommendations are currently lacking.Objectives: The purpose of this study was to calculate statistical values of cherry angioma in the diagnosis of NAFLD. We were looking for evidence to be able to recommend cherry angioma as a screening tool for NAFLD that needs further investigations including ultrasonography.Patients and Methods: We studied individuals who visited the private clinic between July 2011 and December 2012 for health examinations. Physician evaluated each individual by different laboratory tests for systemic, viral and hereditary diseases and excluded those with any of these disease. After completion of physical examination, registration of the cherry angioma diagnosis and lab tests, 340 individuals referred to a radiologist for the diagnosis of NAFLD by abdominal ultrasonography.Results: Among 340 study subjects, 150 (44\%) were males and 190 (55\%) were females. Mean of age and BMI were 47.9 years and 26.9 kg/m2, respectively. Of referred individuals, we diagnosed 238 persons as fatty liver disease through abdominal ultrasonography. We assigned them as NAFLD group. The other 102 individuals were identified with normal livers and were assigned as non-NAFLD group. There was no difference in age and height but for weight and BMI between individuals of NAFLD and non-NAFLD groups. Individuals in NAFLD group were more obese than those in non-NAFLD group. Overall, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy were, 76.9, 80.4, 95.8, 37.5, and 77.4, respectively. All values were higher among women than men. The highest sensitivity was observed in individuals with age {$>$}40 years, and the highest specificity was observed in individuals with age {$\leq$}40 years.Conclusions: In conclusion, NAFLED can be sufficiently predicted by cherry angioma on physical examination.},

  abstract = {This study was undertaken to investigate physiological adaptation with two endurance-training periods differing in intensity distribution. In a randomized crossover fashion, separated by 4 wk of detraining, 12 male cyclists completed two 6-wk training periods: 1) a polarized model [6.4 ({$\pm$}1.4 SD) h/wk; 80\%, 0\%, and 20\% of training time in low-, moderate-, and high-intensity zones, respectively]; and 2) a threshold model [7.5 ({$\pm$}2.0 SD) h/wk; 57\%, 43\%, and 0\% training-intensity distribution]. Before and after each training period, following 2 days of diet and exercise control, fasted skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained for mitochondrial enzyme activity and monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 1 and 4 expression, and morning first-void urine samples were collected for NMR spectroscopy-based metabolomics analysis. Endurance performance (40-km time trial), incremental exercise, peak power output (PPO), and high-intensity exercise capacity (95\% maximal work rate to exhaustion) were also assessed. Endurance performance, PPOs, lactate threshold (LT), MCT4, and high-intensity exercise capacity all increased over both training periods. Improvements were greater following polarized rather than threshold for PPO [mean ({$\pm$}SE) change of 8 ({$\pm$}2)\% vs. 3 ({$\pm$}1)\%, P {$<$} 0.05], LT [9 ({$\pm$}3)\% vs. 2 ({$\pm$}4)\%, P {$<$} 0.05], and high-intensity exercise capacity [85 ({$\pm$}14)\% vs. 37 ({$\pm$}14)\%, P {$<$} 0.05]. No changes in mitochondrial enzyme activities or MCT1 were observed following training. A significant multilevel, partial least squares-discriminant analysis model was obtained for the threshold model but not the polarized model in the metabolomics analysis. A polarized training distribution results in greater systemic adaptation over 6 wk in already well-trained cyclists. Markers of muscle metabolic adaptation are largely unchanged, but metabolomics markers suggest different cellular metabolic stress that requires further investigation.},

SETTING: Four hypertension screening and treatment centers in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Hypertensive men and women, aged 45 to 69 years, with diastolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg. INTERVENTION: Sustained nutritional-hygienic advice to all participants to reduce weight, dietary sodium intake, and alcohol intake, and increase physical activity. Participants were randomly allocated to take (1) placebo (n = 234); (2) chlorthalidone (n = 136); (3) acebutolol (n = 132); (4) doxazosin mesylate (n = 134); (5) amlodipine maleate (n = 131); or (6) enalapril maleate (n = 135). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood pressure, quality of life, side effects, blood lipid levels and analysis of other serum components, echocardiographic and electrocardiographic changes, and incidence of cardiovascular events over an average of 4.4 years of follow-up. RESULTS: Blood pressure reductions were sizable in all six groups, and were significantly greater for participants assigned to drug treatment than placebo (-15.9 vs -9.1 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure and -12.3 vs -8.6 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure; P {$<$} .0001). After 4 years, 59\% of participants assigned to placebo and 72\% of participants given drug treatment continued on their initial medication as monotherapy. A smaller percentage of participants assigned to the drug-treatment groups died or experienced a major nonfatal cardiovascular event than those assigned to the placebo group (5.1\% vs 7.3\%; P = .21). After including other clinical events, the percentage of participants affected was 11.1\% for those in the drug-treatment groups and 16.2\% for those in the placebo group (P = .03). Incidence rates of most resting electrocardiographic abnormalities were lower and quality of life was improved more for those assigned to drug-treatment groups rather than the placebo group. Differences among the five drug treatments did not consistently favor one group in terms of regression of left ventricular mass, blood lipid levels, and other outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: As an initial regimen, drug treatment in combination with nutritional-hygienic intervention was more effective in preventing cardiovascular and other clinical events than was nutritional-hygienic treatment alone. Drug-treatment group differences were minimal. Pending results from large-scale clinical trials to evaluate drug treatments for their effect on cardiovascular clinical events, these findings support the recommendations of the new fifth Joint National Committee report regarding treatment choices for people with stage 1 ("mild") hypertension.},

  abstract = {Most individuals adjust their caffeine intake according to the objective and subjective effects induced by the methylxanthine. However, to reach the desired effects, the quantity of caffeine consumed varies largely among individuals. It has been known for decades that the metabolism, clearance, and pharmacokinetics of caffeine is affected by many factors such as age, sex and hormones, liver disease, obesity, smoking, and diet. Caffeine also interacts with many medications. All these factors will be reviewed in the present document and discussed in light of the most recent data concerning the genetic variability affecting caffeine levels and effects at the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic levels that both critically drive the level of caffeine consumption. The pharmacokinetics of caffeine are highly variable among individuals due to a polymorphism at the level of the CYP1A2 isoform of cytochrome P450, which metabolizes 95\% of the caffeine ingested. Moreover there is a polymorphism at the level of another critical enzyme, N-acetyltransferase 2. At the pharmacodynamic level, there are several polymorphisms at the main brain target of caffeine, the adenosine A2A receptor or ADORA2. Genetic studies, including genome-wide association studies, identified several loci critically involved in caffeine consumption and its consequences on sleep, anxiety, and potentially in neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. We start reaching a better picture on how a multiplicity of biologic mechanisms seems to drive the levels of caffeine consumption, although much more knowledge is still required to understand caffeine consumption and effects on body functions.},

Methods and results The robust and specific association between elevated Lp(a) levels and increased cardiovascular disease (CVD)/coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, together with recent genetic findings, indicates that elevated Lp(a), like elevated LDL-cholesterol, is causally related to premature CVD/CHD. The association is continuous without a threshold or dependence on LDL- or non-HDL-cholesterol levels. Mechanistically, elevated Lp(a) levels may either induce a prothrombotic/anti-fibrinolytic effect as apolipoprotein(a) resembles both plasminogen and plasmin but has no fibrinolytic activity, or may accelerate atherosclerosis because, like LDL, the Lp(a) particle is cholesterol-rich, or both. We advise that Lp(a) be measured once, using an isoform-insensitive assay, in subjects at intermediate or high CVD/CHD risk with premature CVD, familial hypercholesterolaemia, a family history of premature CVD and/or elevated Lp(a), recurrent CVD despite statin treatment, {$\geq$}3\% 10-year risk of fatal CVD according to European guidelines, and/or {$\geq$}10\% 10-year risk of fatal + non-fatal CHD according to US guidelines. As a secondary priority after LDL-cholesterol reduction, we recommend a desirable level for Lp(a) {$<$}80th percentile (less than {$\sim$}50 mg/dL). Treatment should primarily be niacin 1\textendash 3 g/day, as a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled intervention trials demonstrates reduced CVD by niacin treatment. In extreme cases, LDL-apheresis is efficacious in removing Lp(a). Conclusion We recommend screening for elevated Lp(a) in those at intermediate or high CVD/CHD risk, a desirable level {$<$}50 mg/dL as a function of global cardiovascular risk, and use of niacin for Lp(a) and CVD/CHD risk reduction.},

Precision nutrition targeting metabolic pathways altered by ApoE4 provides a tool for the potential prevention of disease. However, no long-term human studies have been conducted to determine effective nutritional protocols for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease in ApoE4 carriers. This may be because relatively little is yet known about the precise mechanisms by which the genetic variant confers an increased risk of dementia. Fortunately, recent research is beginning to shine a spotlight on these mechanisms. These new data open up the opportunity for speculation as to how carriers might ameliorate risk through lifestyle and nutrition. Herein, we review recent discoveries about how ApoE4 differentially impacts microglia and inflammatory pathways, astrocytes and lipid metabolism, pericytes and blood\textendash brain barrier integrity, and insulin resistance and glucose metabolism. We use these data as a basis to speculate a precision nutrition approach for ApoE4 carriers, including a low-glycemic index diet with a ketogenic option, specific Mediterranean-style food choices, and a panel of seven nutritional supplements. Where possible, we integrate basic scientific mechanisms with human observational studies to create a more complete and convincing rationale for this precision nutrition approach. Until recent research discoveries can be translated into long-term human studies, a mechanism-informed practical clinical approach may be useful for clinicians and patients with ApoE4 to adopt a lifestyle and nutrition plan geared towards Alzheimer's risk reduction.},

  abstract = {When lean people adopt carbohydrate-restricted diets (CRDs), they may develop a lipid profile consisting of elevated LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) with low triglycerides (TGs). The magnitude of this lipid profile correlates with BMI such that those with lower BMI exhibit larger increases in both LDL-C and HDL-C. The inverse association between BMI and LDL-C and HDL-C change on CRD contributed to the discovery of a subset of individuals\textemdash termed Lean Mass Hyper-Responders (LMHR)\textemdash who, despite normal pre-diet LDL-C, as compared to non-LMHR (mean levels of 148 and 145 mg/dL, respectively), exhibited a pronounced hyperlipidemic response to a CRD, with mean LDL-C and HDL-C levels increasing to 320 and 99 mg/dL, respectively, in the context of mean TG of 47 mg/dL. In some LMHR, LDL-C levels may be in excess of 500 mg/dL, again, with relatively normal pre-diet LDL-C and absent of genetic findings indicative of familial hypercholesterolemia in those who have been tested. The Lipid Energy Model (LEM) attempts to explain this metabolic phenomenon by positing that, with carbohydrate restriction in lean persons, the increased dependence on fat as a metabolic substrate drives increased hepatic secretion and peripheral uptake of TG contained within very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) by lipoprotein lipase, resulting in marked elevations of LDL-C and HDL-C, and low TG. Herein, we review the core features of the LEM. We review several existing lines of evidence supporting the model and suggest ways to test the model's predictions.},

They demonstrated to improve the lipid profile in high cardiovascular risk patients. Anti-PCSK9 Mab inhibit the targeted low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor degradation induced by PCSK9 protein and are able to reduce LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels on top of conventional lipid-lowering therapy. Though these drugs proved to be very safe in the short-term, little is known about the possible long-term effects, due to the short period of their marketing. The genetic low cholesterol syndromes (LCS) represent the natural models of the lipid-lowering anti-PCSK9 therapy, and a valuable opportunity to predict the long-term effects of these drugs. By looking at the clinical features of such models, we could be able to foresee possible drug-induced side effects. In the present review, the correspondences and discordances between the side effects of anti-PCSK9 therapy and the corresponding LCS models will be examined in the attempt to forecast possible long-term consequences of these novel lipid-lowering agents.},

  abstract = {The response of cerebral vasculature to exercise is different from other peripheral vasculature; it has a small vascular bed and is strongly regulated by cerebral autoregulation and the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2). In contrast to other organs, the traditional thinking is that total cerebral blood flow (CBF) remains relatively constant and is largely unaffected by a variety of conditions, including those imposed during exercise. Recent research, however, indicates that cerebral neuronal activity and metabolism drive an increase in CBF during exercise. Increases in exercise intensity up to {$\sim$}60\% of maximal oxygen uptake produce elevations in CBF, after which CBF decreases toward baseline values because of lower PaCO2 via hyperventilation-induced cerebral vasoconstriction. This finding indicates that, during heavy exercise, CBF decreases despite the cerebral metabolic demand. In contrast, this reduced CBF during heavy exercise lowers cerebral oxygenation and therefore may act as an independent influence on central fatigue. In this review, we highlight methodological considerations relevant for the assessment of CBF and then summarize the integrative mechanisms underlying the regulation of CBF at rest and during exercise. In addition, we examine how CBF regulation during exercise is altered by exercise training, hypoxia, and aging and suggest avenues for future research.},

To determine the mechanism by which vitamin D deficiency mediates accelerated cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes, we investigated the effects of active vitamin D on macrophage cholesterol deposition. Methods and Results We obtained macrophages from 76 obese, diabetic, hypertensive patients with vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D {$<$} 80 nmol/L)(group A) and four control groups: obese, diabetic, hypertensive patients with normal vitamin D (group B, n=15), obese, non-diabetic, hypertensive patients with vitamin D deficiency (group C, n=25), and non-obese, non-diabetic, non-hypertensive patients with vitamin D deficiency (group D, n=10) or sufficiency (group E, n=10). The same patient's macrophages from all groups were cultured in vitamin D-deficient or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) supplemented media and exposed to modified low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. 1,25(OH)2D3 suppressed foam cell formation by reducing acetylated or oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol uptake in diabetics only. Conversely, deletion of the vitamin D receptor in macrophages from diabetic patients accelerated foam-cell formation induced by modified LDL. 1,25(OH)2D3 downregulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation reduced PPAR{$\gamma$} expression, suppressed CD36 expression, and prevented oxLDL-derived cholesterol uptake. In addition, 1,25(OH)2D3 suppression of macrophage endoplasmic reticulum stress improved insulin signaling, downregulated SR-A1expression, and prevented oxLDL and AcLDL-derived cholesterol uptake. Conclusion These results identify reduced vitamin D receptor signaling as a potential mechanism underlying increased foam-cell formation and accelerated cardiovascular disease in diabetics.},

The stereotypical effects of heat or cold exposure are increased wakefulness and decreased rapid eye movement sleep and slow wave sleep. These effects of the thermal environment on sleep stages are strongly linked to thermoregulation, which affects the mechanism regulating sleep. The effects on sleep stages also differ depending on the use of bedding and/or clothing. In semi-nude subjects, sleep stages are more affected by cold exposure than heat exposure. In real-life situations where bedding and clothing are used, heat exposure increases wakefulness and decreases slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep. Humid heat exposure further increases thermal load during sleep and affects sleep stages and thermoregulation. On the other hand, cold exposure does not affect sleep stages, though the use of beddings and clothing during sleep is critical in supporting thermoregulation and sleep in cold exposure. However, cold exposure affects cardiac autonomic response during sleep without affecting sleep stages and subjective sensations. These results indicate that the impact of cold exposure may be greater than that of heat exposure in real-life situations; thus, further studies are warranted that consider the effect of cold exposure on sleep and other physiological parameters.},

  abstract = {Military personnel experience energy deficit (total energy expenditure higher than energy intake), particularly during combat training and field exercises where exercising energy expenditures are high and energy intake is reduced. Low energy availability (energy intake minus exercising energy expenditure expressed relative to fat free mass) impairs endocrine function and bone health, as recognized in female athletes as the Female Athlete Triad syndrome. More recently, the Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S) syndrome encompasses broader health outcomes, physical and cognitive performance, non-athletes, and men. This review summarizes the evidence for the effect of low energy availability and energy deficiency in military training and operations on health and performance outcomes. Energy availability is difficult to measure in free-living individuals but doubly labeled water studies demonstrate high total energy expenditures during military training; studies that have concurrently measured energy intake, or measured body composition changes with DXA, suggest severe and/or prolonged energy deficits. Military training in energy deficit disturbs endocrine and metabolic function, menstrual function, bone health, immune function, gastrointestinal health, iron status, mood, and physical and cognitive performance. There are more data for men than women, and little evidence on the chronic effects of repeated exposures to energy deficit. Military training impairs indices of health and performance, indicative of the Triad and RED-S, but the multi-stressor environment makes it difficult to isolate the independent effects of energy deficiency. Studies supplementing with energy to attenuate the energy deficit suggest an independent effect of energy deficiency in the disturbances to metabolic, endocrine and immune function, and physical performance, but randomized controlled trials are lacking.},

  abstract = {The diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS) have been continuously evolved since 1950's, and gained speed parallel to the development of detailed laboratory methods. The common aim for all the defined criteria up to now, is to establish the dissemination in space and time of the clinical picture caused by the lesions in the central nervous system (CNS), and to rule out other diseases which might mimic MS. There is no definite measure or laboratory marker for the diagnosis of MS, yet. Both the clinical features of the disease, and laboratory investigations such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses are being used., Clinical and imaging findings that may be seen in MS, can also be mimicked by some infectious, neoplastic, genetic, metabolic, vascular and other idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating disorders (IIDD). In the earlier stages of the disease, especially IIDD's such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOs) and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) can cause diagnostic difficulty, however, these disorders which have both distinct pathogeneses and clinical courses than MS, should also be treated differently. Therefore, to identify MS-related attacks and determine the final diagnosis is vital for the correct treatment choice and longterm disability prevention. In this manuscript the principal approach for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of MS has been reviewed regarding the recent guidelines.},

  abstract = {Purpose Atrial fibrillation (AF) is more prevalent in men than women. Due to these sex differences in AF susceptibility, we examined whether sex hormones have differing associations with AF risk in men and women. Methods This analysis included 4,883 (mean age=63{$\pm$}10 years; 39\% women; 64\% non-white) participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Sex hormones (total testosterone, bioavailable testosterone, estradiol, and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)) were measured at baseline (2000\textendash 2002) for all male and all postmenopausal female participants. AF was ascertained by hospital discharge records, Medicare claims data, and study electrocardiograms through December 31, 2012. Results Over a median follow-up of 10.9 years, a total of 613 (13\%) AF cases were detected. A higher incidence rate of AF was observed for males (n=385, age-standardized incidence rate per 1000 person-years=12.3, 95\%CI=11.1, 13.6) than females (n=228, age-standardized incidence rate per 1000 person-years=9.0, 95\%CI=7.9, 10.3). In men, higher bioavailable testosterone levels were associated with increased AF risk (HR=1.32, 95\%CI=1.01, 1.74; p=0.044; comparing 3rd to 1st tertile), while an association in the opposite direction was observed for women (HR=0.81, 95\%CI=0.58, 1.13; p=0.22; comparing 3rd to 1st tertile). Other hormones were not associated with AF in men or women. Conclusion Higher levels of endogenous bioavailable testosterone contribute to AF development in men. The combination of endogenous bioavailable testosterone and other risk factors potentially are important for AF development in men.},

Purified LDL particles appear heterogeneous in images obtained with a 400-kV electron cryomicroscope. Using multivariate statistical and cluster analyses, an ensemble of randomly oriented particle images has been subdivided into homogeneous subpopulations, and the largest subset was used for three-dimensional reconstruction. In contrast to the general belief that below the lipid phase-transition temperature (30\textdegree C) LDL are quasi-spherical microemulsion particles with a radially layered core-shell organization, our three-dimensional map shows that LDL have a well-defined and stable organization. Particles consist of a higher-density outer shell and lower-density inner lamellae-like layers that divide the core into compartments. The outer shell consists of apolipoprotein B-100, phospholipids, and some free cholesterol.},

We aim to assess the association of liver fibrosis by T1-mapping magnetic resonance imaging and CVD in MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis). Methods and Results\textemdash{} MESA enrolled 6814 participants free of clinical CVD at baseline (2000\textendash 2002). A subsample of participants underwent T1-mapping magnetic resonance imaging 10 years after the baseline (Y10 MESA exam, 2010\textendash 2012). Liver T1 maps were generated avoiding vessels and biliary ducts from which native T1 (n=2087) and extracellular volume fraction (ECV, n=1234) were determined. Higher ECV and native T1 were indicators of liver fibrosis. Linear regression analysis evaluated the cross-sectional relationship between liver native T1 and ECV at Y10 MESA exam with a history of CVD events (atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and coronary heart disease [CHD]). Of the 2087 participants (68.7{$\pm$}9.1 years; 46\% females), 153 had prior CVD events (78 atrial fibrillation, 25 heart failure, and 78 CHD). History of CVD events was associated with 18.5 ms higher liver native T1 (P{$<$}0.001) and 1.4\% greater ECV (P=0.06). Prior atrial fibrillation was related to higher liver native T1 ({$\beta$}=21.1; P=0.001) and greater ECV ({$\beta$}=2.2; P=0.02), whereas previous heart failure was associated with greater liver ECV ({$\beta$}=4.1; P=0.02). There was also a relationship of prior CHD with liver native T1 ({$\beta$}=13; P=0.05) and ECV ({$\beta$}=1.9; P=0.05), which was attenuated by adjustment for coronary artery calcium score ({$\beta$}=7.1 and 1.6; P=0.37 and 0.13, respectively). Conclusions\textemdash{} Liver fibrosis by T1-mapping magnetic resonance imaging is associated with history of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and CHD in a multiethnic cohort. The association of liver fibrosis and CHD is at least in part mediated by atherosclerosis.},

However, GBSs in the setting of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains poorly characterized, whilst GBSs prevalence amongst COVID-19 patients has not been previously systematically evaluated using a meta-analytical approach. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational cohort and case series studies reporting on the occurrence, clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19-associated GBSs was performed. A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled estimates and odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (CIs), compared to non-COVID-19, contemporary or historical GBSs patients. RESULTS: Eighteen eligible studies (11 cohorts, seven case series) were identified including a total of 136,746 COVID-19 patients. Amongst COVID-19 patients, including hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases, the pooled GBSs prevalence was 0.15\textperthousand{} (95\% CI 0\%-0.49\textperthousand; I2 ~=~96\%). Compared with non-infected contemporary or historical controls, patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection had increased odds for demyelinating GBSs subtypes (OR 3.27, 95\% CI 1.32\%-8.09\%; I2 ~=~0\%). In SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, olfactory or concomitant cranial nerve involvement was noted in 41.4\% (95\% CI 3.5\%-60.4\%; I2 ~=~46\%) and 42.8\% (95\% CI 32.8\%-53\%; I2 ~=~0\%) of the patients, respectively. Clinical outcomes including in-hospital mortality were comparable between COVID-19 GBSs patients and non-infected contemporary or historical GBSs controls. CONCLUSION: GBSs prevalence was estimated at 15 cases per 100,000 SARS-CoV-2 infections. COVID-19 appears to be associated with an increased likelihood of GBSs and with demyelinating GBSs variants in particular.},

This disorder often escapes diagnosis because neither the ingested food nor the exercise alone induces the symptoms. \textbf{Objective:} The aim of the study was to characterize the allergens involved in wheat-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis and to describe the clinical outcome in a series of 18 adult patients. \textbf{Methods:} All 18 patients had experienced recurrent episodes of generalized urticaria during exercise, 17 patients in association with collapse and 15 patients with an anaphylactic reaction. The symptoms appeared only when the patients had eaten food containing wheat before exercise. Wheat allergens were detected by immunoblotting, purified by gel filtration and reversed-phase chromatography, and subjected to N-terminal sequencing. The IgE-binding ability of the purified proteins was studied by ELISA, and their in vivo reactivity was studied by skin prick testing. \textbf{Results:} IgE antibodies from pooled patient sera were bound to 65-kd and 40-kd wheat proteins in immunoblotting. The 65-kd allergen was a previously undescribed wheat protein, showing 61\% sequence identity to {$\gamma$}-gliadin, whereas the 40-kd allergen had 100\% identity to {$\alpha$}-gliadin. In ELISA, all 18 patients showed elevated IgE levels to the novel {$\gamma$}-like gliadin, and 13 of the patients showed elevated IgE levels to the {$\alpha$}-gliadin. None of the 54 control subjects with wheat allergy, urticaria, or coeliac disease had IgE antibodies to the {$\gamma$}-like gliadin. The in vivo reactivity of the {$\gamma$}-like gliadin was verified by positive skin prick test responses in all of the 15 patients who were tested. During the follow-up on a gluten-free or wheat-free diet, 3 patients experienced reactions after having unknowingly eaten wheat before exercise, but all the other patients who were adhering to the diet remained symptom-free. \textbf{Conclusion:} This study shows that wheat is a frequent cause of food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis and suggests that the major allergen is a previously undescribed {$\gamma$}-like gliadin. For screening of this life-threatening allergy, we recommend skin prick testing with crude gliadin and we recommend a gluten-free diet for treatment.

  abstract = {Background: The aim of the study was to clinically evaluate the effect of miswak as an adjunct to tooth brushing on plaque levels and gingival health in subjects diagnosed with mild to moderate chronic generalized marginal gingivitis in comparison with those of toothbrush users. Materials and Methods: The study comprised of 30 systemically healthy subjects, aged 18-35 years diagnosed with mild to moderate gingivitis. The study was designed as a randomized, single-blind, parallel-armed study. Subjects were randomly divided into three groups. Group A (toothbrush users), group B (toothbrush and miswak users), and group C (miswak users). Subjects were advised to use toothbrush, miswak, or both, three times daily depending on their respective allocations. Gingival index according to Loe and Silness, Plaque index, according to Turesky modified Quigley-Hein plaque index, and the digital photographs of the total labial surfaces of the teeth were taken for image analysis. Recording of data were done at baseline, 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th week time intervals. Obtained data were analyzed using repeated measure ANOVA and student t test (independent samples). Results: Group B showed statistically significant (P{$<$}0.0001) decrease in plaque score and gingival score compared to group A and group C, respectively, from 2nd to 8th week, whereas no statistical significant difference was found in plaque score, when group A was compared with group C (P{$>$}0.05) from 2nd to 4th week. Further at the 6th and 8th week, there was significant difference (P{$<$}0.05) in plaque score between group A and group C. The difference in gingival score was not significant (P{$<$}0.05), when group A was compared with group C on all the indicated time intervals. Conclusion: Results showed significant improvement in plaque score and gingival health when miswak was used as an adjunct to tooth brushing.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), patients with hypertension and high cardiovascular risk treated with intensive blood pressure (BP) control ({$<$}120 mm\,Hg) had fewer major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and deaths but higher rates of treatment-related serious adverse events (SAE) than patients randomized to standard BP control ({$<$}140 mm\,Hg). However, the degree of benefit or harm for an individual patient could vary because of heterogeneity in treatment effect. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using patient-level data from 9361 randomized patients in SPRINT, we developed models to predict risk for MACE or death and treatment-related SAE to allow for individualized BP treatment goals based on each patient's projected risk and benefit of intensive versus standard BP control. Models were internally validated using bootstrap resampling and externally validated on 4741 patients from the ACCORD-BP (The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes blood pressure) trial. Among 9361 SPRINT patients, 755 patients (8.1\%) had a MACE or death event and 338 patients (3.6\%) had a treatment-related SAE during a median follow-up of 3.3 years. The MACE/death and the SAE model had C statistics of 0.72 and 0.70, respectively, in the derivation cohort and 0.69 and 0.65 in ACCORD. The MACE/death model had 10 variables including treatment interactions with age, baseline systolic BP, and diastolic BP, and the SAE model had 8 variables including treatment interaction with number of BP medications. Intensive BP treatment was associated with a mean 2.2{$\pm$}2.6\% lower risk of MACE/death compared with standard treatment (range, 20.7\% lower risk to 19.6\% greater risk among individual patients) and a mean 2.2{$\pm$}1.2\% higher risk for SAEs (range, 0.5\%-15.8\% more harm in individual patients). CONCLUSIONS: To translate the findings from SPRINT to clinical practice, we developed prediction models to tailor the intensity of BP control based on the projected risk and benefit for each unique patient. This approach should be prospectively tested to better engage patients in shared medical decision making and to improve outcomes. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov.

We examined longitudinal patterns of change in blood pressure in healthy male and female volunteers from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA).Methods. Longitudinal mixed-effects regression models are used to estimate the age-associated changes in blood pressure in 1307 men (age 17\textendash 97) and 333 women (age 18\textendash 93) who have been followed for up to 32 years (mean: 8.4 years for men and 3.4 years for women) and who have been screened for health problems or medications that affect blood pressure.Results. On average, systolic pressure is relatively stable in men and women until approximately age 45, increases at 5\textendash 8 mm Hg per decade in middle age, then accelerates in men and stabilizes in women. Diastolic pressure increases at 1 mm Hg per decade at all ages in men, whereas in women the rate of change in diastolic pressure increases in middle age and then plateaus and may decline after age 70. Additional findings include: (a) BLSA cross-sectional and longitudinal findings are more similar than has been observed in studies of unscreened samples; (b) there is no evidence of a gender cross-over in this group of healthy men and women; and (c) compared to previous studies of unscreened samples, healthy BLSA men and women show a weaker association between baseline blood pressure and subsequent rate of blood pressure change.Conclusions. These findings suggest that several previously described age-associated patterns of blood pressure change partially reflect the effects of hypertension and its treatment, rather than intrinsic age changes in the blood pressure of healthy individuals.},

Whether heterozygous APOB deficiency is associated with decreased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) is uncertain. We combined family-based and large scale gene-sequencing to characterize the association of rare PTVs in APOB with circulating LDL-C (LDL cholesterol), triglycerides, and risk for CHD. Methods We sequenced the APOB gene in 29 Japanese hypobetalipoproteinemia families, as well as 57\,973 individuals derived from 12 CHD case-control studies\textemdash 18\,442 with early-onset CHD and 39\,531 controls. We defined PTVs as variants that lead to a premature stop, disrupt canonical splice-sites, or lead to insertions/deletions that shift reading frame. We tested the association of rare APOB PTV carrier status with blood lipid levels and CHD. Results Among 29 familial hypobetalipoproteinemia families, 8 families harbored APOB PTVs. Carrying 1 APOB PTV was associated with 55 mg/dL lower LDL-C (P=3\texttimes 10-5) and 53\% lower triglyceride level (P=2\texttimes 10-4). Among 12 case-control studies, an APOB PTV was present in 0.038\% of CHD cases as compared to 0.092\% of controls. APOB PTV carrier status was associated with a 43 mg/dL lower LDL-C (P=2\texttimes 10-7), a 30\% decrease in triglycerides (P=5\texttimes 10-4), and a 72\% lower risk for CHD (odds ratio, 0.28; 95\% CI, 0.12\textendash 0.64; P=0.002).

Methods: Data were obtained from 9 clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of duloxetine in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Results: In a pooled analysis of 6 short-term treatment trials, in which treatment was stopped abruptly, discontinuationemergent adverse events (DEAEs) were reported by 44.3\% and 22.9\% of duloxetine- and placebo-treated patients, respectively ( p b 0.05). Among duloxetine-treated patients reporting at least 1 DEAE, the mean number of symptoms was 2.4. DEAEs reported significantly more frequently on abrupt discontinuation of duloxetine compared with placebo were dizziness (12.4\%), nausea (5.9\%), headache (5.3\%), paresthesia (2.9\%), vomiting (2.4\%), irritability (2.4\%), and nightmares (2.0\%). Dizziness was also the most frequently reported DEAE in the analyses of 3 long-term duloxetine studies. Across the short- and long-term data sets, 45.1\% of DEAEs had resolved in the duloxetine-treated populations by the end of the respective studies, and the majority of these (65.0\%) resolved within 7 days. Most patients rated the severity of their symptoms as mild or moderate. A higher proportion of patients reporting DEAEs were seen with 120 mg/day duloxetine compared with lower doses. For doses between 40 and 120 mg/day duloxetine the proportion of patients reporting at least one DEAE differed significantly from placebo. Extended treatment with duloxetine beyond 8\textendash 9 weeks did not appear to be associated with an increased incidence or severity of DEAEs. Conclusions: Abrupt discontinuation of duloxetine is associated with a DEAE profile similar to that seen with other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressants.

They are most notorious for causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks in 2002\textendash 2003. All coronaviruses follow the same basic strategy of replication.All coronaviruses encode 15 or 16 replicase related proteins, 4 or 5 structural proteins and 1\textendash 8 group-specific or accessory proteins. Many of the replicase proteins are assembled into replication machinery in double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and on a reticular network of membranes that are derived from the endoplasmic reticulum.Coronaviruses are readily transmitted across species. This phenomenon was illustrated when the SARS-coronavirus crossed species from bats to intermediate hosts, such as palm civets, and then to humans. It also explains the large number of species, including humans, that are infected with viruses closely related to bovine coronavirus.In many coronavirus infections, disease severity increases during virus clearance, suggesting that the host immune response is both protective and pathogenic. Furthermore, inhibition of specific aspects of the immune response results in less severe disease and less tissue destruction, without diminishing the kinetics of virus clearance.Like all successful viruses, coronaviruses have evolved both passive and active mechanisms to evade the interferon response. Replication in DMVs may contribute to passive evasion of the innate immune response by making double-stranded RNA inaccessible to cellular sensors. , Coronaviruses gained prominence during the SARS outbreaks of 2002\textendash 2003, but there are many different coronaviruses that infect humans and animals. Perlman and Netland describe the biology of the coronaviruses, including their replication, host immune response and interspecies transmission., Although coronaviruses were first identified nearly 60 years ago, they only received notoriety in 2003 when one of their members was identified as the aetiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Previously these viruses were known to be important agents of respiratory and enteric infections of domestic and companion animals and to cause approximately 15\% of all cases of the common cold. This Review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of coronavirus replication, interactions with the host immune response and disease pathogenesis. It also highlights the recent identification of numerous novel coronaviruses and the propensity of this virus family to cross species barriers.},

We examined the effect of VM intensity and duration on middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv) responses. Healthy men (n = 10; mean {$\pm$} SD: 26 {$\pm$} 4 years) completed 30\%, 60\%, and 90\% of their maximal VM mouth pressure, for 5 and 10 sec (order randomized) while standing. Beat-to-beat MCAv and MAP during phase I (peak), at nadir (phase III), and recovery are reported as the change from standing baseline. During phase I, MCAv rose 15 {$\pm$} 6 cm{$\cdot$}s-1 (P {$<$} 0.001), which was not reliably different between intensities (P = 0.11), despite graded increases in MAP (P {$<$} 0.001; e.g., +12 {$\pm$} 9 mmHg vs. +35 {$\pm$} 14 for 5 sec 30\% and 90\% VM, respectively). During Phase III, the MCAv response was duration- (P = 0.045) and intensity dependent (P {$<$} 0.001), with the largest decrease observed following the 90\% VM (e.g., -19 {$\pm$} 13 and -15 {$\pm$} 11 cm{$\cdot$}s-1 for 5 and 10 sec VM, respectively) with a concomitant decrease in MAP (P {$<$} 0.001, -23 {$\pm$} 11 and -23 {$\pm$} 9 mmHg). This asymmetric response may be attributable to the differential modulators of MCAv throughout the VM. The mechanical effects of the elevated intrathoracic pressure during phase I may restrain increases in cerebral perfusion via related increases in intracranial pressure; however, during phase III the decrease in MCAv arises from an abrupt hypotension, the extent of which is dependent upon both the duration and intensity of the VM.},

No one wants to overeat. And certainly no one wants to overeat for years, become overweight, and end up with a high risk of diabetes or heart disease--yet two thirds of Americans do precisely that. Even though we know better, we often eat too much. Why does our behavior betray our own intentions to be lean and healthy? The problem, argues obesity and neuroscience researcher Stephan J. Guyenet, is not necessarily a lack of willpower or an incorrect understanding of what to eat. Rather, our appetites and food choices are led astray by ancient, instinctive brain circuits that play by the rules of a survival game that no longer exists. And these circuits don't care about how you look in a bathing suit next summer.To make the case, The Hungry Brain takes readers on an eye-opening journey through cutting-edge neuroscience that has never before been available to a general audience. The Hungry Brain delivers profound insights into why the brain undermines our weight goals and transforms these insights into practical guidelines for eating well and staying slim. Along the way, it explores how the human brain works, revealing how this mysterious organ makes us who we are.},

Although statin therapy is the mainstay for LDL-C lowering, a significant percentage of patients prescribed these agents either do not achieve targets with statin therapy alone or have partial or complete intolerance to them. For such patients, the use of adjuvant therapy capable of providing incremental LDL-C reduction is advised. One such agent is ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor that targets uptake at the jejunal enterocyte brush border. Its primary target of action is the cholesterol transport protein Nieman Pick C1 like 1 protein. Ezetimibe is an effective LDL-C lowering agent and is safe and well tolerated. In response to significant controversy surrounding the use and therapeutic effectiveness of this drug, we provide an update on the biochemical mechanism of action for ezetimibe, its safety and efficacy, as well as the results of recent randomized studies that support its use in a variety of clinical scenarios.},

  abstract = {Background Secondary oligo/amenorrhoea occurs in 3\%\textendash 5\% of women of reproductive age. The two most common causes are polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (2\%\textendash 13\%) and functional hypothalamic amenorrhoea (FHA) (1\%\textendash 2\%). Whilst both conditions have distinct pathophysiology and their diagnosis is supported by guidelines, in practice, differentiating these two common causes of menstrual disturbance is challenging. Moreover, both diagnoses are qualified by the need to first exclude other causes of menstrual disturbance. Aim To review clinical, biochemical and radiological parameters that could aid the clinician in distinguishing PCOS and FHA as a cause of menstrual disturbance. Results FHA is uncommon in women with BMI {$>$} 24 kg/m2, whereas both PCOS and FHA can occur in women with lower BMIs. AMH levels are markedly elevated in PCOS; however, milder increases may also be observed in FHA. Likewise, polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) is more frequently observed in FHA than in healthy women. Features that are differentially altered between PCOS and FHA include LH, androgen, insulin, AMH and SHBG levels, endometrial thickness and cortisol response to CRH. Other promising diagnostic tests with the potential to distinguish these two conditions pending further study include assessment of 5-alpha-reductase activity, leptin, INSL3, kisspeptin and inhibin B levels. Conclusion Further data directly comparing the discriminatory potential of these markers to differentiate PCOS and FHA in women with secondary amenorrhoea would be of value in defining an objective probability for PCOS or FHA diagnosis.},

Only English-language articles published up until February 27, 2013, were considered.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Results{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}MMAS has been diagnosed in patients with systemic reactions to hymenoptera stings and elevated baseline serum tryptase as well as in patients with unexplained episodes of anaphylaxis. A bone marrow biopsy establishes the diagnosis by revealing the presence of monoclonal mast cells that carry the D816V \emph{KIT} mutation and/or express CD25 while the diagnostic requirements for systemic mastocytosis are not met. MCAS affects predominantly women in whom no mast cell abnormality or external triggers account for their episodes of mast cell activation. MCAS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and primary and secondary mast cell activation disorders as well as idiopathic anaphylaxis have to be ruled out before making the diagnosis. Patients with MCAS and MMAS are treated in a stepwise fashion with drugs that block the effects of mediators released by mast cells on activation. One third of MCAS patients experience complete resolution of symptoms with treatment, while one third have a major response and one third a minor response to treatment. A combination of drugs is usually necessary to achieve symptom control. No drug trial has been performed in patients with MMAS and MCAS.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Conclusions{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}MMAS and MCAS are 2 newly described, rare syndromes of mast cell activation. Further studies will be necessary to better understand the cause of these conditions and their natural evolution and to validate and improve the treatment approach. Research should also focus on developing drugs with the potential to cure these debilitating disorders. To achieve these goals, centers with expertise in mast cell activation disorders are essential as they allow for a critical mass of these patients to be enrolled in studies while providing those patients with the most up-to-date diagnostic procedures and treatment strategies.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Suggested mechanisms for reduced HDL levels in FH patients have been altered apolipoprotein A-1 metabolism and elevated cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity, but the molecular basis for hypoalphalipoproteinemia in any of these patients has not yet been identified. We investigated four large families in which individuals were found to be double heterozygotes for both FH and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) deficiency. These double heterozygotes have significantly less HDL cholesterol than persons with FH or LPL heterozygosity alone. In the double heterozygotes, HDL particle composition is not significantly different from FH heterozygotes, suggesting a quantitative rather than qualitative defect in HDL metabolism in these persons. We propose that mutations in the LPL gene may be a cause of low HDL cholesterol levels in some individuals heterozygous for FH.},

Plasma levels of Lp(a) are genetically determined to a large extent.1 High circulating levels of Lp(a) (usually defined as \&gt;50 mg/dL) represent an independent cardiovascular (CV) risk factor for CV disease and contribute to the residual CV risk observed in statin-treated subjects.1 Genome-wide association and Mendelian randomization studies have clearly established a causal association between high Lp(a) levels and vascular atherosclerosis, acute myocardial infarction, and atherosclerotic aortic valve stenosis.1,2 However, whether Lp(a) is still a risk factor in patients with CV events and on statin therapy is uncertain.3 In fact, whereas some studies have suggested a role for Lp(a) in predicting CV risk even in subjects with well-controlled LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, other studies did not.2,4 While no approved specific Lp(a)-lowering drugs exist, LDL-C-lowering drugs have shown different abilities to affect Lp(a) levels. To date, ezetimibe in monotherapy was shown to reduce plasma levels of Lp(a) in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia by {$\sim$}7\%.5 Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition reduces Lp(a) by 20\textendash 30\%,6 likewise nicotinic acid.

Historically, these diseases have been viewed as discrete disorders, each with its own genetic cause and distinct pathogenic cascades that lead to its specific clinical features. However, studies have recently shown that three of these diseases have an unanticipated mechanistic convergence.

The literature describes numerous reports of FDEIAn after intake of very different foods, from vegetables and nuts to meats and seafood. One of the best-characterized types of FDEIAn is that due to {$\omega$}5-gliadin of wheat, though cases of FDEIAn after wheat ingestion by sensitization to wheat lipid transfer protien (LTP) are described. Some pathophysiological mechanisms underlying EIAn have been hypothesized, such as increase/alteration in gastrointestinal permeability, alteration of tissue transglutaminase promoting IgE cross-linking, enhanced expression of cytokines, redistribution of blood during physical exercise leading to altered mast-cell degranulation, and also changes in the acid\textendash base balance. Nevertheless, until now, none of these hypotheses has been validated. The diagnosis of EIAn and FDEIAn is achieved by means of a challenge, with physical exercise alone for EIAn, and with the assumption of the suspected food followed by physical exercise for FDEIAn; in cases of doubtful results, a double-blind placebo-controlled combined food\textendash exercise challenge should be performed. The prevention of this particular kind of anaphylaxis is the avoidance of the specific trigger, ie, physical exercise for EIAn, the assumption of the culprit food before exercise for FDEIAn, and in general the avoidance of the recognized cofactors. Patients must be supplied with an epinephrine autoinjector, as epinephrine has been clearly recognized as the first-line intervention for anaphylaxis.},

  abstract = {Transient vision loss may indicate underlying vascular disease, including carotid occlusion and thromboembolism, or it may have a more benign etiology, such as migraine or vasospasm. This review focuses on the differential diagnosis and workup of patients presenting with transient vision loss, focusing on several key areas: the relationship to thromboembolic vascular disease, hypercoagulable testing, retinal migraine, and bilateral vision loss. The objective is to provide the ophthalmologist with information on how to best manage these patients. Thromboembolic etiologies for transient vision loss are sometimes managed with medications, but when carotid surgery is indicated, earlier intervention may prevent future stroke. This need for early treatment places the ophthalmologist in the important role of expediting the management process. Hospital admission is recommended in patients presenting with transient symptoms within 72 hours who meet certain high-risk criteria. When the cause is giant cell arteritis, ocular ischemic syndrome, or a cardioembolic source, early management of the underlying condition is equally important. For nonthromboembolic causes of transient vision loss such as retinal migraine or retinal vasospasm, the ophthalmologist can provide reassurance as well as potentially give medications to decrease the frequency of vision loss episodes.},

Decades of research suggest that the primary suspects (e.g., viruses, genes, immune system) are associative rather than causative agents, but a surprisingly coherent relationship can be made between multiple sclerosis and fungal toxins. Specifically, certain pathogenic fungi sequester in non-neuronal tissue and release toxins that target and destroy CNS astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Without these glial support cells, myelin degrades triggering the onset of multiple sclerosis and its associated symptoms. We propose here that fungal toxins are the underlying cause of multiple sclerosis and thus may offer an avenue towards an effective cure.},

The aim of the present study was to investigate the predictive value of hyperinsulinemia with regard to CHD risk during a 22-year follow-up of the Helsinki Policemen Study population.Methods and Results\textemdash The study was based on a cohort of 970 men who were 34 to 64 years of age and free of CHD, other cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Risk factor measurements at baseline examination included an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with blood glucose and plasma insulin measurements at 0, 1, and 2 hours. Area under the plasma insulin response curve (AUC insulin) during OGTT was used as a composite variable reflecting plasma insulin levels. During the 22-year follow-up, 164 men had a major CHD event (CHD death or nonfatal myocardial infarction). Age-adjusted hazard ratios for a major CHD event comparing men in the highest AUC insulin quintile with those in the combined 4 lower quintiles during 5-, 10-, 15-, and 22-year follow-up periods were 3.29 (95\% CI, 1.56 to 6.91), 2.72 (95\% CI, 1.67 to 4.42), 2.14 (95\% CI, 1.43 to 3.21), and 1.61 (95\% CI, 1.14 to 2.27), respectively. Further adjustment for other risk factors attenuated these hazard ratios to 2.36 (95\% CI, 1.00 to 5.57), 2.29 (95\% CI, 1.31 to 4.02), 1.76 (95\% CI, 1.09 to 2.82), and 1.32 (95\% CI, 0.89 to 1.97), respectively.Conclusions\textemdash Hyperinsulinemia predicted CHD risk in Helsinki policemen over the 22-year follow-up, and to a large extent independently of other CHD risk factors, but its predictive value diminished with lengthening follow-up time.},

  abstract = {Importance: Little is known about the heterogeneity in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (LDL-C) lowering with proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor medications. Objective: To evaluate the interindividual variability in LDL-C reduction with the PCSK9 inhibitor drug evolocumab. Design, Setting, and Participants: We examined the percentage change in LDL-C levels from baseline in the Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk (FOURIER) trial, a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of the PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab in patients with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who were taking statin medications. Patients in either treatment arm who had high baseline LDL-C variability during screening and either did not receive the study drug, altered their background lipid-lowering therapy regimen, or had no LDL-C level sample in week 4 were excluded from the primary analysis. Analyses in the patients were stratified by treatment arm. Data was collected from 2013 to 2016, and data were analyzed from January 2018 to November 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Interindividual variation in percent reduction in LDL-C with evolocumab. Results: There were 27\,564 individuals in the cohort; after exclusions for baseline variability (n\,=\,3524) or alterations in background lipid therapy and other causes (n\,=\,2272), 21\,768 patients remained. At week 4, the median percent reduction in LDL-C levels from baseline was 66\% (interquartile range, 54\%-76\%; median [interquartile range] baseline value, 90 [79-105] mg/dL; postchange value, 31 [21-44] mg/dL) with evolocumab. During the first year, a total of 10\,325 of 10902 patients in the evolocumab group (94.7\%) had a reduction 50\% or greater in LDL-C levels, 10\,669 of 10\,902 (97.9\%) had a reduction 30\% or more, and 10\,849 of 10\,902 (99.5\%) had any reduction in LDL-C levels. Fifty-three patients (0.5\%) had no apparent reduction in LDL-C levels. In the placebo arm, the median LDL-C reduction was 4\% (interquartile range, 6\% increase to 13\% reduction; baseline median [IQR] value, 90 [79-106] mg/dL; postchange value, 87 [74-103] mg/dL) at 4 weeks. Waterfall plots showed notable variability in the top and bottom 5\% of patients for both evolocumab and placebo groups, with large changes in LDL-C levels in the placebo group (increases of {$\geq$}25\%, 531 patients [4.9\%]; decreases of {$\geq$}25\%, 985 patients [9.1\%]). At 4 weeks, the placebo-adjusted reductions in LDL-C levels with evolocumab were 50\% or greater in 9839 of 10\,866 patients (90.5\%) and 30\% or greater in 10\,846 of 10\,866 patients (99.8\%). Results were consistent across clinically relevant subgroups. Conclusions and Relevance: There appears to be a highly consistent robust reduction in LDL-C levels with evolocumab use.

  abstract = {The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak from December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, has been declared a global public health emergency. Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by SARS-CoV-2 to infect human cells. Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. SARS-CoV-2 may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119~cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs. We also conducted ``CellPhoneDB'' analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues. We found that macrophages frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense and immune pathogenesis.},

We investigated the effect of the nonaromatized natural androgen 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on the rabbit atherogenesis in relation to the proatherogenic molecule lectin-like oxidized-low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) and its downstream molecules. Thirty-nine male New Zealand white rabbits were divided into four groups: 1) noncastrated group with normal chow diet (n = 6); 2) noncastrated group with high-cholesterol diet (HCD) (n = 10); 3) castrated group with HCD plus sc placebo pellet (n = 11); and 4) castrated group with HCD plus sc 150 mg DHT pellet (n = 12). Implantation of sc DHT or placebo pellet was performed at the time of castration. After castration or sham operation, the rabbits were fed the HCD for 8 wk, and plaque areas were assessed in the entire aorta. The HCD-induced increase in plaque area, which was most aggravated in the castration plus placebo group, was attenuated in the castration plus DHT group. Microscopic examination of the proximal descending aorta revealed that DHT significantly reduced HCD-induced foam cell formation, which was mostly composed of macrophages in the intima layer, compared with the placebo group. The decreased accumulation of foam cells with DHT treatment was accompanied by a marked reduction in the expression of LOX-1 mRNA in these cells. In cultured macrophages prepared from male wild-type mice that express the androgen receptor (AR), 1 x 10(-8) m and 1 x 10(-9) m DHT inhibited the formation of foam cells induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein. Moreover, the expression of LOX-1 and inflammatory cytokines in the cultured macrophages was significantly suppressed by DHT. Such suppressive effects of DHT on foam cell formation and cytokine expression were not observed in cultured macrophages prepared from male AR-null mice, suggesting an involvement of AR in the mechanism. In conclusion, physiological levels of DHT attenuated the development of atherosclerosis in rabbits through the suppression of intimal foam cell formation of macrophage partly via the suppression of LOX-1 expression.},

DESIGN: Cross sectional. SETTING: Department of Human reproduction at a tertiary pediatric referral center. PARTICIPANTS: Eight hundred thirty-five adolescent girls. INTERVENTIONS: Postmenarcheal girls were classified according to the regularity of their menstrual cycles in 2 groups (regular and irregular cycles) and compared. Anthropometric measurements and ultrasonographic examination of the pelvis was conducted with all participants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anthropometric and ultrasonographic parameters were evaluated. RESULTS: Results of our study showed that girls with regular and irregular cycles differed in height, weight, body mass index, percentage of body fat and ovarian volumes. The size of the ovaries decreases in the group of girls with regular cycles (r~=~0.14; P~{$<~$}.005), while it increases in girls with irregular cycles (r~=~0.15; P~{$<~$}.001) with advancing age. Uterine volume in all patients increases gradually with age reaching consistent values at 16~years (r~=~0.5; P~{$<~$}.001). Age at menarche, the time elapsed since menarche, the height, weight, body mass index and percentage of body fat in patients correlated with uterine volume. Ovarian volume correlated with patients' weight, BMI and percentage of fat. CONCLUSION: Uterus continues to grow in postmenarcheal years, with increasing height and weight of girls, regardless of the regularity of cycles. Postmenarcheal girls with irregular cycles were found to have heavier figures and larger ovaries.},

We investigated whether CAC progression and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) reduction have a complementary prognostic impact.Methods and Results\textemdash{} We measured the change in CAC in 495 asymptomatic subjects submitted to sequential electron-beam tomography (EBT) scanning. Statins were started after the initial EBT scan. Myocardial infarction (MI) was recorded in 41 subjects during a follow-up of 3.2{$\pm$}0.7 years. Mean LDL level did not differ between groups (118{$\pm$}25 mg/dL versus 122{$\pm$}30 mg/dL, MI versus no MI). On average, MI subjects demonstrated a CAC change of 42\%{$\pm$}23\% yearly; event-free subjects showed a 17\%{$\pm$}25\% yearly change (P=0.0001). Relative risk of having an MI in the presence of CAC progression was 17.2-fold (95\% CI: 4.1 to 71.2) higher than without CAC progression (P{$<$}0.0001). In a Cox proportional hazard model, the follow-up score (P=0.034) as well as a score change {$>$}15\% per year (P{$<$}0.001) were independent predictors of time to MI.Conclusions\textemdash{} Progression of CAC was significantly greater in patients receiving statins who had an MI compared with event-free subjects despite similar LDL control.

  abstract = {Obesity associated dyslipidemia and its negative effects on the heart and blood vessels have emerged as a major healthcare challenge around the globe. The use of statins, potent inhibitors of hydroxyl-methyl glutaryl (HMG) Co-A reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, has significantly reduced the rates of cardiovascular and general mortality in patients with coronary artery disease. How statins lower plasma cholesterol levels presents a mechanistic conundrum since persistent exposure to these drugs in vitro or in vivo is known to induce overexpression of the HMG Co-A reductase gene and protein. In an attempt to solve this mechanistic puzzle, Schonewille et al, studied detailed metabolic parameters of cholesterol synthesis, inter-organ flux and excretion in mice treated with 3 common statins, rosuvastatin, atorvastatin or lovastatin, each with its unique pharmacokinetics. From the measurements of the rates of heavy water (D2O) and [13C]-acetate incorporation into lipids, the authors calculated the rates of whole body and organ-specific cholesterol synthesis in control and statin-treated mice. These analyses revealed dramatic enhancement in the rates of hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis in statin-treated mice that concomitantly elicited lower levels of cholesterol in their plasma. The authors have provided strong evidence to indicate that statin treatment in mice led to induction of compensatory metabolic pathways that apparently mitigated an excessive accumulation of cholesterol in the body. It was noted however that changes in cholesterol metabolism induced by 3 statins were not identical. While sustained delivery of all 3 statins led to enhanced rates of biliary excretion of cholesterol and its fecal elimination, only atorvastatin treated mice elicited enhanced trans-intestinal cholesterol excretion. Thus, blockade of HMGCR by statins in mice was associated with profound metabolic adaptations that reset their cholesterol homeostasis. The findings of Schonewille et al, deserve to be corroborated and extended in patients in order to more effectively utilize these important cholesterol-lowering drugs in the clinic.},

The objective of this study was to determine the interrelations of CAD, serum squalene and sterols, and cholesterol metabolism with each other in postmenopausal women. For this purpose, we measured serum squalene and sterols and fecal steroids (cholesterol and bile acids) and squalene by gas-liquid chromatography and evaluated cholesterol absorption and synthesis in postmenopausal women with CAD (n=29) and age-matched controls (n=20). On similar dietary lipid intake, the cholesterol absorption efficiency and mean serum cholesterol level were comparable, but the squalene-to-cholesterol ratio was higher in cases than in controls. The presence of CAD was inversely associated with fecal total steroids (logistic regression coefficient {$\beta$}/SE=-2.11, P=0.04) and cholesterol synthesis ({$\beta$}/SE=-2.14, P=0.04) and turnover ({$\beta$}/SE=-2.19, P=0.03) after adjustment for dietary cholesterol, family history of CAD, smoking, low and high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and serum triglyceride levels. A high serum squalene ratio was not related to cholesterol synthesis but was inversely related to fecal squalene excretion, which was lower in cases than in controls. In conclusion, the presence of CAD in postmenopausal women is independently associated with altered cholesterol metabolism, as reflected by low synthesis and inefficient elimination of cholesterol.},

The disease was named after a turban-shelled snail known as "cigua" in the Spanish Antilles, which was mistakenly thought to be the cause of this disease.1 More than 200 species of fish have been implicated, the most common of which include grouper, red snapper, barracuda, amberjack, and less commonly mackerel, surgeonfish, and sea bass. Toxin-containing fish may be found in tropical areas extending approximately 35 degrees latitude on either side of the equator, but the increase in air travel and the relative ease of shipping fish long distances have meant that both travelers and people living outside those areas may be affected.2 In major endemic areas, including the Caribbean and the South Pacific islands, the incidence of ciguatera poisoning ranges from 50-500 cases annually per 10,000 population, making it one of the more common illnesses in those areas. I report two cases of ciguatera poisoning in a husband and wife following barracuda ingestion and briefly review the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of this disease.},

OBSERVATIONS: I report 23 otherwise healthy patients (22 females, 1 male) who developed EIV after walking or hiking in hot weather. Erythematous, urticarial or purpuric plaques arose on the lower legs, not involving skin compressed by socks. Symptoms included itch, pain, and burning sensation. Lesions resolved after some days. Relapses were frequent at further muscular exercise, and could be prevented in some cases by compression hosiery, manual lymphatic drainage, intake of oedema protective agents, or steroids (local or systemic). INVESTIGATIONS: Histopathology demonstrated leucocytoclastic vasculitis in five biopsies, and urticarial vasculitis in one. Extensive blood investigations have been performed in six patients and were negative. No clear relation with chronic venous disease (duplex or Doppler) had been established in 12 patients. CONCLUSIONS: I suggest denominating this condition exercise-induced vasculitis. This clinical entity is well defined, but poorly recognized. The presentation of 23 original cases demonstrates its reality.},

  abstract = {Background The associations of blood pressure with the different manifestations of incident cardiovascular disease in a contemporary population have not been compared. In this study, we aimed to analyse the associations of blood pressure with 12 different presentations of cardiovascular disease. Methods We used linked electronic health records from 1997 to 2010 in the CALIBER (CArdiovascular research using LInked Bespoke studies and Electronic health Records) programme to assemble a cohort of 1{$\cdot$}25 million patients, 30 years of age or older and initially free from cardiovascular disease, a fifth of whom received blood pressure-lowering treatments. We studied the heterogeneity in the age-specific associations of clinically measured blood pressure with 12 acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases, and estimated the lifetime risks (up to 95 years of age) and cardiovascular disease-free life-years lost adjusted for other risk factors at index ages 30, 60, and 80 years. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01164371. Findings During 5{$\cdot$}2 years median follow-up, we recorded 83\hphantom{,}098 initial cardiovascular disease presentations. In each age group, the lowest risk for cardiovascular disease was in people with systolic blood pressure of 90\textendash 114 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of 60\textendash 74 mm Hg, with no evidence of a J-shaped increased risk at lower blood pressures. The effect of high blood pressure varied by cardiovascular disease endpoint, from strongly positive to no effect. Associations with high systolic blood pressure were strongest for intracerebral haemorrhage (hazard ratio 1{$\cdot$}44 [95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}32\textendash 1{$\cdot$}58]), subarachnoid haemorrhage (1{$\cdot$}43 [1{$\cdot$}25\textendash 1{$\cdot$}63]), and stable angina (1{$\cdot$}41 [1{$\cdot$}36\textendash 1{$\cdot$}46]), and weakest for abdominal aortic aneurysm (1{$\cdot$}08 [1{$\cdot$}00\textendash 1{$\cdot$}17]). Compared with diastolic blood pressure, raised systolic blood pressure had a greater effect on angina, myocardial infarction, and peripheral arterial disease, whereas raised diastolic blood pressure had a greater effect on abdominal aortic aneurysm than did raised systolic pressure. Pulse pressure associations were inverse for abdominal aortic aneurysm (HR per 10 mm Hg 0{$\cdot$}91 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}86\textendash 0{$\cdot$}98]) and strongest for peripheral arterial disease (1{$\cdot$}23 [1{$\cdot$}20\textendash 1{$\cdot$}27]). People with hypertension (blood pressure {$\geq$}140/90 mm Hg or those receiving blood pressure-lowering drugs) had a lifetime risk of overall cardiovascular disease at 30 years of age of 63{$\cdot$}3\% (95\% CI 62{$\cdot$}9\textendash 63{$\cdot$}8) compared with 46{$\cdot$}1\% (45{$\cdot$}5\textendash 46{$\cdot$}8) for those with normal blood pressure, and developed cardiovascular disease 5{$\cdot$}0 years earlier (95\% CI 4{$\cdot$}8\textendash 5{$\cdot$}2). Stable and unstable angina accounted for most (43\%) of the cardiovascular disease-free years of life lost associated with hypertension from index age 30 years, whereas heart failure and stable angina accounted for the largest proportion (19\% each) of years of life lost from index age 80 years. Interpretation The widely held assumptions that blood pressure has strong associations with the occurrence of all cardiovascular diseases across a wide age range, and that diastolic and systolic associations are concordant, are not supported by the findings of this high-resolution study. Despite modern treatments, the lifetime burden of hypertension is substantial. These findings emphasise the need for new blood pressure-lowering strategies, and will help to inform the design of randomised trials to assess them.

Guidance regarding whether pregnant persons should receive a COVID-19 vaccine is needed. Because pregnant persons were excluded from the initial phase 3 clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines, limited data are available on their efficacy and safety during pregnancy. After developmental and reproductive toxicology studies are completed, some companies are expected to conduct clinical trials in pregnant persons. Until then, pregnant persons and their obstetricians will need to use available data to weigh the benefits and risks of COVID-19 vaccines. Issues to be considered when counseling pregnant persons include data from animal studies and inadvertently exposed pregnancies during vaccine clinical trials when available, potential risks to pregnancy of vaccine reactogenicity, timing of vaccination during pregnancy, evidence for safety of other vaccines during pregnancy, risk of COVID-19 complications due to pregnancy and the pregnant person's underlying conditions, and risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and potential for risk mitigation.

  abstract = {Little attention has been paid to the function of lipoproteins as part of a nonspecific immune defense system that binds and inactivates microbes and their toxins effectively by complex formation. Because of high extra-capillary tissue pressure, aggregates of such complexes may be trapped in vasa vasorum of the major arteries. This complex formation and aggregation may be enhanced by hyperhomocysteinemia, because homocysteine thiolactone reacts with the free amino groups of apo-B to form homocysteinylated low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which is subject to spontaneous precipitation in vitro. Obstruction of the circulation in vasa vasorum, caused by the aggregated complexes, may result in local ischemia in the arterial wall, intramural cell death, bursting of the capillary, and escape of microorganisms into the intima, all of which lead to inflammation and creation of vulnerable plaques. The presence of homocysteinylated LDL and oxidized LDL stimulates production of LDL autoantibodies, which may start a vicious circle by increasing the complex formation and aggregation of lipoproteins. The content of necrotic debris and leukocytes and the higher temperature than its surroundings give the vulnerable plaque some characteristics of a micro-abscess that by rupturing may initiate an occluding thrombosis. This suggested chain of events explains why many of the clinical symptoms and laboratory findings in acute myocardial infarction are similar to those seen in infectious diseases. It explains the presence of microorganisms in atherosclerotic plaques and why bacteriemia and sepsis are often seen in myocardial infarction complicated with cardiogenic shock. It explains the many associations between infections and cardiovascular disease. And it explains why cholesterol accumulates in the arterial wall. Some risk factors may not cause vascular disease directly, but they may impair the immune system, promote microbial growth, or cause hyperhomocysteinemia, leading to vulnerable plaques.},

  abstract = {Background Recent evidence indicates a potential therapeutic role of fluvoxamine for COVID-19. In the TOGETHER trial for acutely symptomatic patients with COVID-19, we aimed to assess the efficacy of fluvoxamine versus placebo in preventing hospitalisation defined as either retention in a COVID-19 emergency setting or transfer to a tertiary hospital due to COVID-19. Methods This placebo-controlled, randomised, adaptive platform trial done among high-risk symptomatic Brazilian adults confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 included eligible patients from 11 clinical sites in Brazil with a known risk factor for progression to severe disease. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either fluvoxamine (100 mg twice daily for 10 days) or placebo (or other treatment groups not reported here). The trial team, site staff, and patients were masked to treatment allocation. Our primary outcome was a composite endpoint of hospitalisation defined as either retention in a COVID-19 emergency setting or transfer to tertiary hospital due to COVID-19 up to 28 days post-random assignment on the basis of intention to treat. Modified intention to treat explored patients receiving at least 24 h of treatment before a primary outcome event and per-protocol analysis explored patients with a high level adherence ({$>$}80\%). We used a Bayesian analytic framework to establish the effects along with probability of success of intervention compared with placebo. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04727424) and is ongoing. Findings The study team screened 9803 potential participants for this trial. The trial was initiated on June 2, 2020, with the current protocol reporting randomisation to fluvoxamine from Jan 20 to Aug 5, 2021, when the trial arms were stopped for superiority. 741 patients were allocated to fluvoxamine and 756 to placebo. The average age of participants was 50 years (range 18\textendash 102 years); 58\% were female. The proportion of patients observed in a COVID-19 emergency setting for more than 6 h or transferred to a teritary hospital due to COVID-19 was lower for the fluvoxamine group compared with placebo (79 [11\%] of 741 vs 119 [16\%] of 756); relative risk [RR] 0{$\cdot$}68; 95\% Bayesian credible interval [95\% BCI]: 0{$\cdot$}52\textendash 0{$\cdot$}88), with a probability of superiority of 99{$\cdot$}8\% surpassing the prespecified superiority threshold of 97{$\cdot$}6\% (risk difference 5{$\cdot$}0\%). Of the composite primary outcome events, 87\% were hospitalisations. Findings for the primary outcome were similar for the modified intention-to-treat analysis (RR 0{$\cdot$}69, 95\% BCI 0{$\cdot$}53\textendash 0{$\cdot$}90) and larger in the per-protocol analysis (RR 0{$\cdot$}34, 95\% BCI, 0{$\cdot$}21\textendash 0{$\cdot$}54). There were 17 deaths in the fluvoxamine group and 25 deaths in the placebo group in the primary intention-to-treat analysis (odds ratio [OR] 0{$\cdot$}68, 95\% CI: 0{$\cdot$}36\textendash 1{$\cdot$}27). There was one death in the fluvoxamine group and 12 in the placebo group for the per-protocol population (OR 0{$\cdot$}09; 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}01\textendash 0{$\cdot$}47). We found no significant differences in number of treatment emergent adverse events among patients in the fluvoxamine and placebo groups. Interpretation Treatment with fluvoxamine (100 mg twice daily for 10 days) among high-risk outpatients with early diagnosed COVID-19 reduced the need for hospitalisation defined as retention in a COVID-19 emergency setting or transfer to a tertiary hospital.

  abstract = {Male rabbits were fed for 6 months a purified diet rich in fat (45\% of calories), mostly saturated (butter) containing per 100 g either 354 mg of calcium and 46 mg of magnesium (group I), 948 mg of calcium and 46 mg of magnesium (group II), or 354 mg of calcium and 356 mg of magnesium (group III). In group II, fed the additional calcium, significant (P {$<$} 0.001) changes were observed; i.e. prolongation of clotting time (platelet clotting activity), decrease in platelet aggregation to thrombin, and in the concentration of the plasma total cholesterol, with a less significant (P {$<$} 0.05) decrease in plasma triglycerides. A significant (P {$<$} 0.01) decrease in the ratio monoemes/ 18:2 in the plasma cholesterol esters but not in the plasma or platelet phospholipids was also found in these rabbits. In relation to their lower activity, platelets from group II exhibited a significant increase in 22:4n-6 (phospholipids) and in the ratio cholesterol/phospholipids, both significantly correlated with the platelet function tests. In this same group, the excretion of fecal lipids and saturated fatty acid 18:0 was increased by 4.3-fold and 7.6-fold, respectively. The severity of atherosclerosis and the accumulation of cholesterol in the aorta were significantly lower in group II, while the plasma level of calcium was similar to that of group I. In group III, fed additional magnesium, results were similar to those of group II, but less significant. It seems that calcium (and magnesium) markedly decreased the atherogenicity of saturated fats by promoting their fecal excretion, thus decreasing their untoward effects on serum lipids and platelet functions. These results may be related to the known protective effect of hard water on coronary heart disease.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to review the role of the family history in predictive genetic testing, describe how family history taking is practiced in adult primary care, identify the current barriers to appropriate application of the family history, and outline the requirements for a new family history tool for primary care. DESIGN: We reviewed current perspectives on the family history, identifying key references in the medical literature and web-based family history tools through discussions with multiple content experts in clinical genetics, family medicine, and internal medicine. We conducted a Medline query using the search terms family history and primary care to identify references from the past 10 years. To illustrate the usefulness of family history information, we calculated the predictive value of family history and genetic information for familial adenomatous polyposis using current references and standard formulas. We identified paper and web-based family history tools through discussions with content experts. We also conducted a search on the World Wide Web to identify resources for electronic medical record and family history. RESULTS: The family history is the most important tool for diagnosis and risk assessment in medical genetics, and promises to serve as a critical element in the use of predictive genetic testing in primary care. Traditional medical education about family history has often been unsophisticated and use of family history in adult primary care has been limited, compounded by multiple substantive barriers. Although there are numerous paper and computer-based aides for taking the family history, none currently meets all the needs of adult primary care. CONCLUSIONS: The patient's family history remains a critical element in risk assessment for many conditions, but substantive barriers impede application in primary care practice, and evidence for its contribution to improved health outcomes is limited in this setting. Short of radical changes in reimbursement, new tools will be required to aid primary care physicians in the efficient collection and application of patient family history in the era of genetic testing.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to examine blood pressure (BP) and cholesterol levels among centenarians in Australia, and to compare the relationship between these biological parameters with cognitive and functional status. METHODS: We performed BP (n = 142) and cholesterol (n = 67) measurements using the Omron automated sphygmomanometer (Omron Healthcare, Melbourne, Australia) and the LDX Cholestech Analyzer (Inverness Medical, San Diego, CA), respectively. A medical history was also obtained. Cognitive and functional statuses were assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (Katz ADL), respectively. RESULTS: Average age of participants was 101.1 years. Hypertension was demonstrated in 1\% according to the WHO criterion ({$\geq$}140/90 mm Hg). However, 38\% of centenarians were hypertensive, defined as having a medical diagnosis of hypertension, and/or being on antihypertensive medications, and/or having a BP measurement {$\geq$} 140/90 mm Hg. Mean values were: systolic = 130 mm Hg (90-182 mm Hg), diastolic = 70 mm Hg (44-98 mm Hg), and pulse pressure (PP) = 60 mm Hg (20-130 mm Hg). Hypercholesterolaemia was only detected in 8\% of participants. Hypertension was not associated with increased risk of hypercholesterolaemia. Low systolic BP (SBP) and narrower PP was associated with lower MMSE scores. High SBP and wider PP was associated with better functional status. CONCLUSIONS: Centenarians have a very low prevalence of high BP and high cholesterol compared with the general population. There seems to be an inverse relationship between the risk factors for cardiovascular disease vs. the risk factors for dementia in our sample. There appears to be a complex interaction between BP and health in old age.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In type 2 diabetics, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is 20\% higher than in non-diabetics, and low vitamin D levels nearly double the relative risk of developing CVD compared to diabetic patients with normal vitamin D levels. However, the mechanism(s) by which vitamin D deficiency leads to an increased susceptibility to atherosclerosis in these patients is unknown. We studied the effects of vitamin D replacement on macrophage cholesterol metabolism and foam cell formation in obese, hypertensive diabetics and non-diabetic controls. We found that 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] suppressed foam cell formation by reducing acetylated low density lipoprotein (AcLDL) and oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) cholesterol uptake in diabetics only. 1,25(OH)2D3 downregulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation reduced PPARgamma and CD36 expression, and prevented oxLDL-derived cholesterol uptake. In addition, 1,25(OH)2D3 suppression of macrophage endoplasmic reticulum stress improved insulin signaling, downregulated SR-A1 expression, and prevented oxLDL- and AcLDL-derived cholesterol uptake. The results of this research reveal novel insights into the mechanisms linking vitamin D signaling to foam cell formation in diabetics and suggest a potential new therapeutic target to reduce cardiovascular risk in this population.},

The effect of carbohydrate, fat, and protein intakes on 24-h energy expenditure (24EE) and substrate oxidations was measured in a respiratory chamber during day 4 of weight maintenance and day 7 of ad libitum intake. Ad libitum intake resulted in a 7-d overfeeding of 6468 +/- 3824 kJ/d above weight-maintenance requirements, leading to a 2.3 +/- 1.2-kg gain. The 10,975 +/- 3774 kJ excess energy intake on day 7 of ad libitum intake caused a 1205 +/- 920 kJ/d increase in 24EE (delta 24EE = 0.17 x delta intake - 695; r = 0.71, P less than 0.02). Of the excess carbohydrate intake, 74\% was oxidized (r = 0.86, P less than 0.001), whereas excess fat intake was not.

  abstract = {CONTEXT: In the general population, about 30\% of asymptomatic women have polycystic ovary-like abnormalities (PCO-L), i.e. polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) at ultrasound and/or increased anti-M\"ullerian hormone (AMH) serum level. PCOM has also been reported in 30-50\% of women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to verify whether both PCOM and excessive AMH level indicate PCO-L in FHA and to elucidate its significance. DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective analysis using a database and comparison with a control population. SETTING: Subjects received ambulatory care in an academic hospital. PATIENTS: Fifty-eight patients with FHA were compared to 217 control women with nonendocrine infertility and body mass index of less than 25 kg/m(2). INTERVENTIONS: There were no interventions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured serum testosterone, androstenedione, FSH, LH, AMH, and ovarian area values. The antral follicle count (AFC) was used as a binary variable (i.e. negative or positive) because of the evolution of its sensitivity over the time of this study. The ability of these variables (except AFC) to detect PCO-L in both populations was tested by cluster analysis. RESULTS: One cluster (cluster 2) suggesting PCO-L was detected in the control population (n = 52; 24\%), whereas two such clusters were observed in the FHA population (n = 22 and n = 6; 38 and 10\%; clusters 2 and 3, respectively). Cluster 2 in FHA had similar features of PCO-L as cluster 2 in controls, with higher prevalence of positive AFC (70\%) and PCOM (70\%), higher values of ovarian area and higher serum AMH (P {$<$} 0.0001 for all), and testosterone levels (P {$<$} 0.01) than in cluster 1. Cluster 3 in FHA was peculiar, with frankly elevated AMH levels. In the whole population (controls + FHA), PCO-L was significantly associated with lower FSH values (P {$<$} 0.0001). CONCLUSION: PCO-L in FHA is a frequent and usually incidental finding of unclear significance, as in controls. The association of PCO-L with hypothalamic amenorrhea should not lead to a mistaken diagnosis of PCOS.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor evolocumab reduced LDL cholesterol and cardiovascular events in the FOURIER trial. In this prespecified analysis of FOURIER, we investigated the efficacy and safety of evolocumab by diabetes status and the effect of evolocumab on glycaemia and risk of developing diabetes. METHODS: FOURIER was a randomised trial of evolocumab (140 mg every 2 weeks or 420 mg once per month) versus placebo in 27\hphantom{,}564 patients with atherosclerotic disease who were on statin therapy, followed up for a median of 2{$\cdot$}2 years. In this prespecified analysis, we investigated the effect of evolocumab on cardiovascular events by diabetes status at baseline, defined on the basis of patient history, clinical events committee review of medical records, or baseline HbA1c of 6{$\cdot$}5\% (48 mmol/mol) or greater or fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of 7{$\cdot$}0 mmol/L or greater. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospital admission for unstable angina, or coronary revascularisation. The key secondary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. We also assessed the effect of evolocumab on glycaemia, and on the risk of new-onset diabetes among patients without diabetes at baseline. HbA1c was measured at baseline then every 24 weeks and FPG was measured at baseline, week 12, week 24, and every 24 weeks thereafter, and potential cases of new-onset diabetes were adjudicated centrally. In a post-hoc analysis, we also investigated the effects on glycaemia and diabetes risk in patients with prediabetes (HbA1c 5{$\cdot$}7-6{$\cdot$}4\% [39-46 mmol/mol] or FPG 5{$\cdot$}6-6{$\cdot$}9 mmol/L) at baseline. FOURIER is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01764633. FINDINGS: At study baseline, 11\hphantom{,}031 patients (40\%) had diabetes and 16\hphantom{,}533 (60\%) did not have diabetes (of whom 10\hphantom{,}344 had prediabetes and 6189 had normoglycaemia). Evolocumab significantly reduced cardiovascular outcomes consistently in patients with and without diabetes at baseline. For the primary composite endpoint, the hazard ratios (HRs) were 0{$\cdot$}83 (95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}75-0{$\cdot$}93; p=0{$\cdot$}0008) for patients with diabetes and 0{$\cdot$}87 (0{$\cdot$}79-0{$\cdot$}96; p=0{$\cdot$}0052) for patients without diabetes (pinteraction=0{$\cdot$}60). For the key secondary endpoint, the HRs were 0{$\cdot$}82 (0{$\cdot$}72-0{$\cdot$}93; p=0{$\cdot$}0021) for those with diabetes and 0{$\cdot$}78 (0{$\cdot$}69-0{$\cdot$}89; p=0{$\cdot$}0002) for those without diabetes (pinteraction=0{$\cdot$}65). Evolocumab did not increase the risk of new-onset diabetes in patients without diabetes at baseline (HR 1{$\cdot$}05, 0{$\cdot$}94-1{$\cdot$}17), including in those with prediabetes (HR 1{$\cdot$}00, 0{$\cdot$}89-1{$\cdot$}13). Levels of HbA1c and FPG were similar between the evolocumab and placebo groups over time in patients with diabetes, prediabetes, or normoglycaemia. Among patients with diabetes at baseline, the proportions of patients with adverse events were 78{$\cdot$}5\% (4327 of 5513 patients) in the evolocumab group and 78{$\cdot$}3\% (4307 of 5502 patients) in the placebo group; among patients without diabetes at baseline, the proportions with adverse events were 76{$\cdot$}8\% (6337 of 8256 patients) in the evolocumab group and 76{$\cdot$}8\% (6337 of 8254 patients) in the placebo group. INTERPRETATION: PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab significantly reduced cardiovascular risk in patients with and without diabetes. Evolocumab did not increase the risk of new-onset diabetes, nor did it worsen glycaemia. These data suggest evolocumab use in patients with atherosclerotic disease is efficacious and safe in patients with and without diabetes. FUNDING: Amgen.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The FOURIER trial (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Patients With Elevated Risk) recently showed that the PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9) inhibitor evolocumab significantly reduced major vascular events in patients with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, including patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI). Within the broad group of patients with prior MI, we hypothesized that readily ascertainable features would identify subsets who derive greater clinical risk reduction with evolocumab. METHODS: The 22\,351 patients with a prior MI were characterized on the basis of time from most recent MI, number of prior MIs, and presence of residual multivessel coronary artery disease ({$\geq$}40\% stenosis in {$\geq$}2 large vessels). The relative and absolute risk reductions in major vascular events, including the primary end point (cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization) and the key secondary end point (cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke), with evolocumab in these subgroups were compared. RESULTS: A total of 8402 patients (38\%) were within 2 years of their most recent MI; 5285 patients (24\%) had {$\geq$}2 prior MIs; and 5618 patients (25\%) had residual multivessel coronary artery disease. In a multivariable-adjusted model that simultaneously included all 3 high-risk features and other baseline covariates, more recent MI, multiple prior MIs, and residual multivessel coronary disease remained independent predictors of cardiovascular outcomes, with adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for the primary end point of 1.37 (95\% confidence interval [CI],1.22-1.53), 1.78 (95\% CI, 1.59-1.99), and 1.39 (95\% CI, 1.24-1.56; all P{$<$}0.001). The relative risk reductions with evolocumab for the primary end point tended to be greater in the high-risk subgroups and were 20\% (HR, 0.80; 95\% CI, 0.71-0.91), 18\% (HR, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.72-0.93), and 21\% (HR, 0.79; 95\% CI, 0.69-0.91) for those with more recent MI, multiple prior MIs, and residual multivessel coronary artery disease, whereas they were 5\% (HR, 0.95; 95\% CI, 0.85-1.05), 8\% (HR, 0.92; 95\% CI, 0.84-1.02), and 7\% (HR, 0.93; 95\% CI, 0.85-1.02) in those without, respectively. Given the higher baseline risk, the respective absolute risk reductions at 3 years exceeded 3\% in the high-risk groups (3.4\%, 3.7\%, and 3.6\%) versus {$\approx$}1\% in the low-risk groups (0.8\%, 1.3\%, and 1.2\%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients closer to their most recent MI, with multiple prior MIs, or with residual multivessel coronary artery disease are at high risk for major vascular events and experience substantial risk reductions with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering with evolocumab.

  abstract = {Most COVID-19 vaccines are designed to elicit immune responses, ideally neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Several vaccines, including mRNA, adenoviral-vectored, protein subunit and whole-cell inactivated virus vaccines, have now reported efficacy in phase III trials and have received emergency approval in many countries. The two mRNA vaccines approved to date show efficacy even after only one dose, when non-NAbs and moderate T helper 1 cell responses are detectable, but almost no NAbs. After a single dose, the adenovirus vaccines elicit polyfunctional antibodies that are capable of mediating virus neutralization and of driving other antibody-dependent effector functions, as well as potent T cell responses. These data suggest that protection may require low levels of NAbs and might involve other immune effector mechanisms including non-NAbs, T cells and innate immune mechanisms. Identifying the mechanisms of protection as well as correlates of protection is crucially important to inform further vaccine development and guide the use of licensed COVID-19 vaccines worldwide.},

  abstract = {The metabolism of cholesterol and its 5-dihydro derivative, cholestanol, was investigated by means of sterol balance and isotope kinetic techniques in 3 subjects with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) and 11 other individuals. All subjects were hospitalized on a metabolic ward and were fed diets practically free of cholesterol and cholestanol. After the intravenous administration of [1,2-3H]cholestanol, the radioactive sterol was transported and esterified in plasma lipoproteins in an identical manner to cholesterol. In these short-term experiments, the specific activity-time curves of plasma cholestanol conformed to two-pool models in both the CTX and control groups. However, cholestanol plasma concentrations, total body miscible pools, and daily synthesis rates were two to five times greater in the CTX than control individuals. The short-term specific activity decay curves of plasma [4-14C]cholesterol also conformed to two-pool models in both groups. However, in the CTX subjects the decay was more rapid, and daily cholesterol synthesis was nearly double that of the control subjects. Plasma concentrations and the sizes of the rapidly turning over pool of exchangeable cholesterol were apparently small in the CTX subjects, and these measurements did not correlate with the large cholesterol deposits found in tendon and tuberous xanthomas., Despite active cholesterol synthesis, bile acid formation was subnormal in the CTX subjects. However, bile acid sequestration was accompanied by a rise in plasma cholestanol levels and greatly augmented fecal cholestanol outputs. In contrast, the administration of clofibrate lowered plasma cholesterol levels 50\% and presumably reduced synthesis in the CTX subjects. Plasma cholesterol concentrations and fecal steroid excretion did not change significantly during this therapy., These findings indicate that the excessive tissue deposits of cholesterol and cholestanol that characterize CTX were associated with hyperactive neutral sterol synthesis. The demonstration of subnormal bile acid formation suggests that defective bile acid synthesis may predispose to the neutral sterol abnormalities.},

MMR, BCG, PPD, and Candida vaccines are already used as treatment options enhancing the ability of the immune system to recognize certain viral antigen. Overall, we suggest that the bystander immunity induced after vaccination of children from 1-8 years old can stimulate the immunity against SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therefore, we recommend assessing the use of one or combined vaccination of MMR, BCG, PPD, and Candida to either protect the high-risk groups or to treat the emerging pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 virus and the associated serious complication of COVID-19.},

Conversely, the profound reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in this disorder might decrease cardiovascular risk. In the present study, we assessed hepatic steatosis as well as noninvasive surrogate markers for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in subjects with FHBL and in matched controls. Methods and Results\textemdash{} Hepatic steatosis was assessed by abdominal ultrasonography. Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and distal common carotid arterial wall stiffness as surrogate markers for CVD risk were measured using high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography. Whereas transaminase levels were only modestly elevated, both prevalence (54\% versus 29\%; P=0.01) and severity of steatosis were significantly higher in FHBL individuals compared with controls. Despite similar IMT measurements, arterial stiffness was significantly lower in FHBL (P=0.04) compared with controls. Additionally, the increase in arterial stiffness as seen in the presence of traditional risk factors was attenuated, suggesting that very low levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins can negate the adverse effects of other risk factors on the vasculature. Conclusions\textemdash{} FHBL is characterized by an increased prevalence and severity of fatty liver disease. The observed decreased level of arterial wall stiffness, most pronounced in the presence of nonlipid risk factors, is indicative of cardiovascular protection in these subjects.},

(published online on July 14 at NEJM.org)1 is a hopeful step toward controlling the Covid-19 pandemic. However, this vaccine and other DNA and RNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 continuously stimulate cellular production of the target antigen. A mechanism is required to be able to stop the antigen production after a period of time to avoid the possibility of eventual desensitization, as is seen with allergen immunotherapy.2-5 Without such a mechanism, a sustained lack of response may make SARS-CoV-2 infection a lot worse in . . .},

  abstract = {Lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) is recognised as a risk factor for arterial and venous thrombosis, a property which may relate to its structural similarity to plasminogen. Pregnancy is associated with a hypofibrinolytic state. Elevated Lp(a) may influence fibrinolysis and have an unfavourable role in pregnancy outcome. In this study alterations in plasma Lp(a) concentrations during normal pregnancy was examined, in a detailed longitudinal investigation, in ten women together with changes in other lipid parameters. In addition, Lp(a) concentrations were examined in subjects with pre-eclampsia (n=10) relative to matched controls (n=10), since it has recently been reported that a substantial increase in circulating Lp(a) occurs in this disorder. Lp(a) concentration increased steadily in normal pregnancy between 10 and 35 weeks with a doubling of the median value from 14.5 to 27.0 mg/dl (P=0.01). A significant increase in Lp(a) values was observed in all subjects with increasing gestation (median rise 190\%, range 117-340\%). This increase was intermediate to those seen in plasma triglyceride and cholesterol. No significant difference in Lp(a) values was observed in subjects with pre-eclampsia, compared with matched normal pregnancy controls (median 14 mg/dl [IQR 4.7-69.0] in pre-eclampsia vs 20 mg/dl [9.0-56. 3] in controls; P=0.57), at a median gestation of 32 weeks. In conclusion, there is a 2-fold increase in Lp(a) during normal pregnancy, which may influence fibrinolysis. Circulating Lp(a) is not significantly elevated in women with pre-eclampsia, and thus is unlikely to play a role in the pathophysiology of this disorder.},

Design: Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group comparison over three menstrual cycles. Setting: General medicine community clinics. Participants: 178 women were screened and 170 were evaluated (active 86; placebo 84). Mean age was 36 years, mean cycle length was 28 days, mean duration of menses was 4.5 days. Interventions: Agnus castus (dry extract tablets) one tablet daily or matching placebo, given for three consecutive cycles. Main outcome measures: Main efficacy variable: change from baseline to end point (end of third cycle) in women's self assessment of irritability, mood alteration, anger, headache, breast fullness, and other menstrual symptoms including bloating. Secondary efficacy variables: changes in clinical global impression (severity of condition, global improvement, and risk or benefit) and responder rate (50\% reduction in symptoms). Results: Improvement in the main variable was greater in the active group compared with placebo group (P{$<$}0.001). Analysis of the secondary variables showed significant (P{$<$}0.001) superiority of active treatment in each of the three global impression items. Responder rates were 52\% and 24\% for active and placebo, respectively. Seven women reported mild adverse events (four active; three placebo), none of which caused discontinuation of treatment. Conclusions: Dry extract of agnus castus fruit is an effective and well tolerated treatment for the relief of symptoms of the premenstrual syndrome.},

To distinguish compound from drug target failure, we compared evidence from clinical trials and drug target Mendelian randomization of CETP protein concentration, comparing this to Mendelian randomization of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). We show that previous failures of CETP inhibitors are likely compound related, as illustrated by significant degrees of between-compound heterogeneity in effects on lipids, blood pressure, and clinical outcomes~observed in trials. On-target CETP inhibition, assessed through Mendelian randomization, is expected to reduce the risk of CHD, heart failure, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease, while increasing the risk of age-related macular degeneration. In contrast, lower PCSK9 concentration is anticipated to decrease the risk of CHD, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, multiple sclerosis, and stroke, while potentially increasing the risk of Alzheimer's disease and asthma. Due to distinct effects on lipoprotein metabolite profiles, joint inhibition of CETP and PCSK9 may provide added benefit. In conclusion, we provide genetic evidence that CETP is an effective target for CHD prevention but with a potential on-target adverse effect on age-related macular degeneration.},

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of homocysteine-lowering therapy on clinical outcome after percutaneous coronary intervention. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial involving 553 patients referred to the University Hospital in Bern, Switzerland, from May 1998 to April 1999 and enrolled after successful angioplasty of at least 1 significant coronary stenosis ({$>$} or = 50\%). INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to receive a combination of folic acid (1 mg/d), vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin, 400 micro g/d), and vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride, 10 mg/d) (n = 272) or placebo (n = 281) for 6 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Composite end point of major adverse events defined as death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and need for repeat revascularization, evaluated at 6 months and 1 year. RESULTS: After a mean (SD) follow-up of 11 (3) months, the composite end point was significantly lower at 1 year in patients treated with homocysteine-lowering therapy (15.4\% vs 22.8\%; relative risk [RR], 0.68; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-0.96; P =.03), primarily due to a reduced rate of target lesion revascularization (9.9\% vs 16.0\%; RR, 0.62; 95\% CI, 0.40-0.97; P =.03). A nonsignificant trend was seen toward fewer deaths (1.5\% vs 2.8\%; RR, 0.54; 95\% CI, 0.16-1.70; P =.27) and nonfatal myocardial infarctions (2.6\% vs 4.3\%; RR, 0.60; 95\% CI, 0.24-1.51; P =.27) with homocysteine-lowering therapy. These findings remained unchanged after adjustment for potential confounders. CONCLUSION: Homocysteine-lowering therapy with folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 significantly decreases the incidence of major adverse events after percutaneous coronary intervention.},

One patient (0.7\%) died in the treatment group versus 13 patients (3.5\%) in the untreated group (odds ratio 0.2, 95\% CI 0.03-1.5; p=0.16). There were no cardiac side effects. Conclusions: Risk stratification-based treatment of COVID-19 outpatients as early as possible after symptom onset with the used triple therapy, including the combination of zinc with low dose hydroxychloroquine, was associated with significantly less hospitalizations and 5 times less all-cause deaths.},

  abstract = {Statins are competitive inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis. Statins reduce plasma cholesterol levels, but whether this is actually caused by inhibition of de novo cholesterol synthesis has not been clearly established. Using three different statins, we investigated the effects on cholesterol metabolism in mice in detail. Surprisingly, direct measurement of whole body cholesterol synthesis revealed that cholesterol synthesis was robustly increased in statin-treated mice. Measurement of organ-specific cholesterol synthesis demonstrated that the liver is predominantly responsible for the increase in cholesterol synthesis. Excess synthesized cholesterol did not accumulate in the plasma, as plasma cholesterol decreased. However, statin treatment led to an increase in cholesterol removal via the feces. Interestingly, enhanced cholesterol excretion in response to rosuvastatin and lovastatin treatment was mainly mediated via biliary cholesterol secretion, whereas atorvastatin mainly stimulated cholesterol removal via the transintestinal cholesterol excretion pathway. Moreover, we show that plasma cholesterol precursor levels do not reflect cholesterol synthesis rates during statin treatment in mice. In conclusion, cholesterol synthesis is paradoxically increased upon statin treatment in mice. However, statins potently stimulate the excretion of cholesterol from the body, which sheds new light on possible mechanisms underlying the cholesterol-lowering effects of statins.},

The minority of human FHBL is caused by truncation-specifying mutations of the \emph{APOB} gene on chromosome 2. In seven families, linkage to chromosome 2 is absent, linkage is instead to chromosome 3 (3p21). In others, linkage is absent to both APOB and to 3p21. Apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) levels are {$\sim$}25\% of normal, instead of the 50\% expected based on the presence of one normal allele due to reduced rates of production. The presence of the truncating mutation seems to have a "dominant recessive" effect on apoB-100 secretion. Concentrations of apoB truncations in plasma differ by truncation but average at {$\sim$}10\% of normal levels. Lipoproteins bearing truncated forms of apoB are cleared more rapidly than apoB-100 particles. In contrast with apoB-100 particles cleared primarily in liver via the LDL receptor, most apoB truncation particles are cleared in renal proximal tubular cells via megalin. Since apoB defects cause a dysfunctional VLDL-triglyceride transport system, livers accumulate fat.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Hepatic synthesis of fatty acids is reduced in compensation.

Some therapies that may reduce cardiovascular risk, such as aspirin, statins, fibrates, and ezetimibe, have little effect on Lp(a) and in some cases may even increase its concentration. Other agents that reduce levels of Lp(a), such as niacin or cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors, have neutral or only slightly favorable effects on cardiovascular outcomes. The only currently available therapeutic approaches that lower Lp(a) and reduce cardiovascular risk are PCSK9 inhibitors and lipoprotein apheresis. For PCSK9 inhibitors, the magnitude of clinical benefit is associated with the baseline level of Lp(a) and appears to be associated with the degree of Lp(a) reduction. Antisense oligonucleotides and small interfering RNA agents targeting apolipoprotein(a) have the potential to reduce circulating Lp(a) concentrations by more than 70\%. The results of cardiovascular outcomes trials will determine whether such substantial reductions in Lp(a) are associated with meaningful clinical benefit.},

We aimed to evaluate the effect of the inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9-i) on steatosis biomarkers such as triglyceride-glucose index (TyG) and hepatic steatosis index (HSI) and analyse the role of TG/HDL in this population before and after adding-on PCSK9-i. Methods and results In this observational study, we evaluated 26 genetically confirmed FH patients with NAFLD and an LDL-C off-target despite high-intensity statins plus ezetimibe. All patients added PCSK9-i treatment and obtained biochemical analysis and TyG and HSI evaluation at baseline and after six months of PCSK9-i. No difference of steatosis biomarkers was found after adding-on PCSK9-i therapy. In a secondary analysis, we divided the study population in two groups according to TG/HDL median value: high TG/HDL group (H-TG/HDL) and low TG/HDL group (L-TG/HDL). TyG and HSI were significantly lower in the L-TG/HDL than H-TG/HDL group (for TyG 9.05~{$\pm~$}0.34 vs 9.51~{$\pm~$}0.32; for HSI 38.43~{$\pm~$}1.35 vs 41.35~{$\pm~$}1.83, p value for both~{$<~$}0.05). After six months of PCSK9-i therapy, TyG and HSI were significantly reduced in the L-TG/HDL group after PCSK9-i therapy (-7.5\% and -8.4\% respectively, p value for both~{$<~$}0.05) and these biomarkers were lower compared to H-TG/HDL group (for TyG 8.37~{$\pm~$}0.14 vs 9.19~{$\pm~$}0.12; for HSI 35.19~{$\pm~$}1.32 vs 39.48~{$\pm~$}1.33, p value for both~{$<~$}0.05).

Total homocysteine level (tHcy) is an independent risk marker for atherosclerosis including that found in AA. The purpose of this study was to prospectively test the association between AA atheroma progression and tHcy. Methods: This is a cohort study of 307 consecutive hospitalized stroke/TIA patients undergoing transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) as a part of their clinical workup. Measurable AA atheroma was detected in 167 patients of whom 125 consented to a protocol-mandated follow-up TEE at 12\,months. Patients had evaluation for vascular risk factors, dietary factors (folate, B12 and pyridoxine), and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphism. One hundred eighteen stroke/TIA patients had tHcy, acceptable paired AA images, and detailed plaque measurements. An increase by {$\geq$}1 grade of AA atheroma was defined as progression. Results: Of the 118 patients, 33 (28\%) showed progression and 17 (14\%) showed regression of their index arch lesion at 1\,year. tHcy ({$\geq$}14.0\,{$\mu$}mol/l) was significantly associated with progression on both univariate (RR\,=\,3.4, 95\% CI 2.0\textendash 5.8) and multivariate analyses (adjusted RR\,=\,3.6, 95\% CI 2.2\textendash 4.6). The changes in AA plaque thickness (r2\,=\,0.11; p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and AA plaque area (r2\,=\,0.08; p\,=\,0.002) correlated with tHcy. tHcy was associated with change in plaque thickness over 12\,months, independent of age, dietary factors, renal function and MTHFR polymorphism (Standardized {$\beta$}-coefficient 0.335, p\,=\,0.02). Conclusions: Our results validate the association and a linear correlation between tHcy and progression of AA atheroma.},

Insulin sensitivity was assessed 4 h postexercise with a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic (40 mU.m(2).min(-1)) clamp enriched with [6,6-(2)H]glucose. Insulin sensitivity was 54\% higher after Ex (P {$<$} 0.01), but there was no change with Met + Ex. Skeletal muscle AMPKalpha2 activity was elevated threefold (P {$<$} 0.01) after Ex, but there was no increase with MET + Ex. These findings suggest that the combination of short-term metformin treatment and an acute bout of exercise does not enhance insulin sensitivity, and the addition of metformin may attenuate the well-documented effects of exercise alone.},

Asthma attacks, cholinergic urticaria and angioedema, and cardiac arrythmias are recognized as exertion-related phenomena in predisposed patients but are distinct from the syndrome described here. A syndrome characterized by the exertion-related onset of cutaneous pruritus and warmth, the development of generalized urticaria, and the appearance of such additional manifestations as collapse in 12 patients, gastrointestinal tract symptoms in five patients, and upper respiratory distress in 10 patients has been designated exercise-induced anaphylaxis, because of the striking similarity of this symptom complex to the anaphylactic syndrome elicited by ingestion or injection of a foreign antigenic substance. There is a family history of atopic disease for 11 patients and cold urticaria for two others and a personal history of atopy in six. The size of the wheals, the failure to develop an attack with a warm bath or shower or a fever, and the prominence of syncope rule against the diagnosis of conventional cholinergic urticaria.

Clinical guidelines across the world are contradictory.To examine whether antihypertensive treatment is associated with a low risk of mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in low-risk patients with mild hypertension.In this longitudinal cohort study, data were extracted from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, from January 1, 1998, through September 30, 2015, for patients aged 18 to 74 years who had mild hypertension (untreated blood pressure of 140/90-159/99 mm Hg) and no previous treatment. Anyone with a history of CVD or CVD risk factors was excluded. Patients exited the cohort if follow-up records became unavailable or they experienced an outcome of interest.Prescription of antihypertensive medication. Propensity scores for likelihood of treatment were constructed using a logistic regression model. Individuals treated within 12 months of diagnosis were matched to untreated patients by propensity score using the nearest-neighbor method.The rates of mortality, CVD, and adverse events among patients prescribed antihypertensive treatment at baseline, compared with those who were not prescribed such treatment, using Cox proportional hazards regression.A total of 19\,143 treated patients (mean [SD] age, 54.7\,[11.8] years; 10 705 [55.9\%] women; 10 629 [55.5\%] white) were matched to 19\,143 similar untreated patients (mean [SD] age, 54.9 [12.2] years; 10 631 [55.5\%] female; 10 654 [55.7\%] white). During a median follow-up period of 5.8 years (interquartile range, 2.6-9.0 years), no evidence of an association was found between antihypertensive treatment and mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02; 95\% CI, 0.88-1.17) or between antihypertensive treatment and CVD (HR, 1.09; 95\% CI, 0.95-1.25). Treatment was associated with an increased risk of adverse events, including hypotension (HR, 1.69; 95\% CI, 1.30-2.20; number needed to harm at 10 years [NNH10], 41), syncope (HR, 1.28; 95\% CI, 1.10-1.50; NNH10, 35), electrolyte abnormalities (HR, 1.72; 95\% CI, 1.12-2.65; NNH10, 111), and acute kidney injury (HR, 1.37; 95\% CI, 1.00-1.88; NNH10, 91).This prespecified analysis found no evidence to support guideline recommendations that encourage initiation of treatment in patients with low-risk mild hypertension. There was evidence of an increased risk of adverse events, which suggests that physicians should exercise caution when following guidelines that generalize findings from trials conducted in high-risk individuals to those at lower risk.},

  abstract = {The autonomic (including sudomotor, baroreceptor, and vasomotor) functions were assessed in 3 groups of individuals, comprising normal, hyperhidrotic, and denervated subjects. The normal group had no palmar hyperhidrosis, with intact T2-3 ganglia, the hyperhidrotic group had palmar hyperhidrosis with intact T2-3 ganglia, and the denervated group had palmar hyperhidrosis treated with T2-3 ganglionectomy. Compared with both the normal and hyperhidrotic subjects, the denervated subjects had a much smaller sweating response of both the forehead, the upper chest region and the upper extremities, and a much greater sweating response of both the lateral lumbar and ventral thigh regions in response to body exercise. In addition, cardiovascular responses to either the Valsalva manoeuver, face immersion, or finger immersion were evaluated in these groups of subjects. When compared with those of either the normal or the denervated subjects, the hyperhidrotic subjects had less reflex bradycardia in response to either Valsalva manoeuver or face immersion. In contrast, when compared with those of either the normal or the denervated subjects, the hyperhidrotic subjects had a higher degree of cutaneous vasoconstriction in response to finger (or cold) immersion. The data indicate that the sympathetic fibers passing through the T2-3 ganglia play an important role in the elaboration or modulation of autonomic function elsewhere. Probably, the hyperhidrotic subjects have an over-functioning of the sympathetic nervous fibers which pass through the T2-3 ganglia, which leads to autonomic dysfunction. The autonomic dysfunctions observed in the hyperhidrotic subjects could be eliminated after the interruption of the excessive sympathetic activities passing through the T2-3 ganglia level.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether pretreatment of the urethra with topical lidocaine reduces the pain associated with urethral catheterization. METHODS: This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized clinical trial of 36 alert, cooperative male adult patients requiring urethral catheterization, without allergies to the study medications or contraindications to their use, from a suburban university-based ED. Patients in the experimental group had topical lidocaine 2\% gel injected in their urethras, whereas control patients received intraurethral lubrication only. Standardized catheterization with a no. 16 Foley was performed followed by pain assessment. The primary outcome measured was pain of catheterization on a 100-mm visual analog scale. Other outcomes included ease of insertion and procedural bleeding. RESULTS: The authors evaluated 36 patients evenly distributed between study groups. Mean age was 62 years (range 22-85). Compared with controls, patients pretreated with lidocaine experienced significantly less pain of catheterization (38 +/- 28 mm vs. 58 +/- 30 mm; mean difference 20 mm; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] = 0.4 to 32; p = 0.04) and less pain of injection (23 +/- 17 mm vs. 40 +/- 25 mm; mean difference 17 mm; 95\% CI = 3 to 32 mm; p = 0.02). There were no differences in the number of attempts and incidence of adverse events between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Use of topical lidocaine gel reduces the pain associated with male urethral catheterization in comparison with topical lubricants only.},

  abstract = {Background There have been recent reports of myocarditis (including myocarditis, pericarditis or myopericarditis) as a side-effect of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, particularly in young males. Less information is available regarding the risk of myocarditis from COVID-19 infection itself. Such data would be helpful in developing a complete risk-benefit analysis for this population. Methods A de-identified, limited data set was created from the TriNetX Research Network, aggregating electronic health records from 48 mostly large U.S. Healthcare Organizations (HCOs). Inclusion criteria were a first COVID-19 diagnosis during the April 1, 2020 - March 31, 2021 time period, with an outpatient visit 1 month to 2 years before, and another 6 months to 2 years before that. Analysis was stratified by sex and age (12-17, 12-15, 16-19). Patients were excluded for any prior cardiovascular condition. Primary outcome was an encounter diagnosis of myocarditis within 90 days following the index date. Rates of COVID-19 cases and myocarditis not identified in the system were estimated and the results adjusted accordingly. Wilson score intervals were used for 95\% confidence intervals due to the very low probability outcome. Results For the 12-17-year-old male cohort, 6/6,846 (0.09\%) patients developed myocarditis overall, with an adjusted rate per million of 876 cases (Wilson score interval 402 - 1,911). For the 12-15 and 16-19 male age groups, the adjusted rates per million were 601 (257 - 1,406) and 561 (240 - 1,313).For 12-17-year-old females, there were 3 (0.04\%) cases of myocarditis of 7,361 patients. The adjusted rate was 213 (73 - 627) per million cases. For the 12-15- and 16-19-year-old female cohorts the adjusted rates per million cases were 235 (64 - 857) and 708 (359 - 1,397). The outcomes occurred either within 5 days (40.0\%) or from 19-82 days (60.0\%). Conclusions Myocarditis (or pericarditis or myopericarditis) from primary COVID19 infection occurred at a rate as high as 450 per million in young males. Young males infected with the virus are up 6 times more likely to develop myocarditis as those who have received the vaccine.},

The World Health Organization (WHO) recently prioritized patient safety areas in primary care, and included diagnostic errors as a high-priority problem. In addition, a recent report from the Institute of Medicine in the USA, `Improving Diagnosis in Health Care', concluded that most people will likely experience a diagnostic error in their lifetime. In this narrative review, we discuss the global significance, burden and contributory factors related to diagnostic errors in primary care. We synthesize available literature to discuss the types of presenting symptoms and conditions most commonly affected. We then summarize interventions based on available data and suggest next steps to reduce the global burden of diagnostic errors. Research suggests that we are unlikely to find a `magic bullet' and confirms the need for a multifaceted approach to understand and address the many systems and cognitive issues involved in diagnostic error. Because errors involve many common conditions and are prevalent across all countries, the WHO's leadership at a global level will be instrumental to address the problem. Based on our review, we recommend that the WHO consider bringing together primary care leaders, practicing frontline clinicians, safety experts, policymakers, the health IT community, medical education and accreditation organizations, researchers from multiple disciplines, patient advocates, and funding bodies among others, to address the many common challenges and opportunities to reduce diagnostic error. This could lead to prioritization of practice changes needed to improve primary care as well as setting research priorities for intervention development to reduce diagnostic error.},

The challenges of early detection include identification of at-risk individuals in the general population who would benefit from longitudinal surveillance programs, and appropriate biomarker and imaging-based modalities utilized for PDAC surveillance in such cohorts. In recent years, various subgroups at higher than average risk for PDAC have been identified, including those with familial risk due to germline mutations, a history of pancreatitis, patients with mucinous pancreatic cysts, and elderly patients with new onset diabetes (NOD). The last two categories will be discussed at length in terms of the opportunities and challenges they present for PDAC early detection.

Using the procrastination\textendash health model as our guiding conceptual lens, we addressed this gap by examining how and why trait procrastination may be linked to various dimensions of sleep quality across two student samples. In Study 1, procrastination was associated with feeling unrested, but not with sleep disturbance frequency, in a sample of Greek undergraduate students (N = 141). In Study 2, bootstrapping analysis of the indirect effects of procrastination on an index of sleep quality through perceived stress in a sample of Canadian students (N = 339) was significant, supporting an extended procrastination\textendash health model view of how chronic self-regulation failure may compromise sleep quality. Given the potential for dynamic and reciprocal relations among procrastination, stress, and sleep quality, suggested by the current and other research, the ways in which procrastination may contribute to and be influenced by poor sleep quality warrant further investigation.},

Among the many risk factors identified by epidemiological studies, only elevated levels of lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein (apo) B can drive the development of atherosclerosis in humans and experimental animals even in the absence of other risk factors2. However, the mechanisms that lead to atherosclerosis are still poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that the subendothelial retention of atherogenic apoB-containing lipoproteins is the initiating event in atherogenesis3. The extracellular matrix of the subendothelium, particularly proteoglycans, is thought to play a major role in the retention of atherogenic lipoproteins4. The interaction between atherogenic lipoproteins and proteoglycans involves an ionic interaction between basic amino acids in apoB100 and negatively charged sulphate groups on the proteoglycans5. Here we present direct experimental evidence that the atherogenicity of apoB-containing low-density lipoproteins (LDL) is linked to their affinity for artery wall proteoglycans. Mice expressing proteoglycan-binding-defective LDL developed significantly less atherosclerosis than mice expressing wild-type control LDL. We conclude that subendothelial retention of apoB100-containing lipoprotein is an early step in atherogenesis.},

  abstract = {Resistance training is commonly prescribed to enhance strength/power qualities and is achieved via improved neuromuscular recruitment, fiber type transition, and/ or skeletal muscle hypertrophy. The rate and amount of muscle hypertrophy associated with resistance training is influenced by a wide array of variables including the training program, plus training experience, gender, genetic predisposition, and nutritional status of the individual. Various dietary interventions have been proposed to influence muscle hypertrophy, including manipulation of protein intake, specific supplement prescription, and creation of an energy surplus. While recent research has provided significant insight into optimization of dietary protein intake and application of evidence based supplements, the specific energy surplus required to facilitate muscle hypertrophy is unknown. However, there is clear evidence of an anabolic stimulus possible from an energy surplus, even independent of resistance training. Common textbook recommendations are often based solely on the assumed energy stored within the tissue being assimilated. Unfortunately, such guidance likely fails to account for other energetically expensive processes associated with muscle hypertrophy, the acute metabolic adjustments that occur in response to an energy surplus, or individual nuances like training experience and energy status of the individual. Given the ambiguous nature of these calculations, it is not surprising to see broad ranging guidance on energy needs. These estimates have never been validated in a resistance training population to confirm the ``sweet spot'' for an energy surplus that facilitates optimal rates of muscle gain relative to fat mass. This review not only addresses the influence of an energy surplus on resistance training outcomes, but also explores other pertinent issues, including ``how much should energy intake be increased,'' ``where should this extra energy come from,'' and ``when should this extra energy be consumed.'' Several gaps in the literature are identified, with the hope this will stimulate further research interest in this area. Having a broader appreciation of these issues will assist practitioners in the establishment of dietary strategies that facilitate resistance training adaptations while also addressing other important nutrition related issues such as optimization of fuelling and recovery goals. Practical issues like the management of satiety when attempting to increase energy intake are also addressed.},

  abstract = {STRENGTH TRAINING METHODS AND THE WORK OF ARTHUR JONES. Smith D, Bruce-Low S. JEPonline. 2004;7(6):52-68. This paper reviews research evidence relating to the strength training advice offered by Arthur Jones, founder and retired Chairman of Nautilus Sports/Medical Industries and MedX Corporation. Jones advocated that those interested in improving their muscular size, strength, power and/or endurance should perform one set of each exercise to muscular failure (volitional fatigue), train each muscle group no more than once (or, in some cases, twice) per week, perform each exercise in a slow, controlled manner and perform a moderate number of repetitions (for most people, \textasciitilde 8-12). This advice is very different to the strength training guidelines offered by the National Strength and Conditioning Association, the American College of Sports Medicine and most exercise physiology textbooks. However, in contrast to the lack of scientific support for most of the recommendations made by such bodies and in such books, Jones' training advice is strongly supported by the peer-reviewed scientific literature, a statement that has recently been supported by a review of American College of Sports Medicine resistance training guidelines. Therefore, we strongly recommend Jones' methods to athletes and coaches, as they are time-efficient and optimally efficacious, and note that, given his considerable contribution to the field of strength training, academic recognition of this contribution is long overdue.},

  abstract = {Primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is governed at present by the risk factor model for cardiovascular events, a model which is widely accepted by physicians and professional associations, but which has important limitations: most critically, that effective treatment to reduce arterial damage is often delayed until the age at which cardiovascular events become common. This delay means that many of the early victims of vascular disease will not be identified in time. This delay also allows atherosclerosis to develop and progress unchecked within the arterial tree with the result that the absolute effectiveness of preventive therapy is limited by the time it is eventually initiated. The causal exposure model of vascular disease is an alternative to the risk factor model for cardiovascular events. Whereas the risk factor model aims to identify and treat those at markedly increased risk of vascular events within the next decade, the causal exposure model of vascular disease aims to prevent events by treating the causes of the disease when they are identified. In the risk factor model, age is an independent non-modifiable risk factor and the predictive power of age far outweighs that of the other risk factors. In the causal exposure model, age is the duration of time the arterial wall is exposed to the causes of atherosclerosis: apoB (apolipoprotein B) lipoproteins, hypertension, diabetes and smoking. Preventing the development of advanced atherosclerotic lesions by treating the causes of vascular disease is the simplest, surest and most effective way to prevent clinical events.},

A novel CHD risk-assessment (CHDRA) tool was developed for intermediate-risk stratification using biomarkers and established risk factors to significantly improve CHD risk discrimination. Hypothesis Physicians will change their treatment plan in response to more information about a patient's CHD risk level provided by the CHDRA test. Methods A Web-based survey of cardiology, internal medicine, family practice, and obstetrics/gynecology physicians (n\,=\,206) was conducted to assess the CHDRA clinical impact. Each physician was shown 3 clinical vignettes representing community-based cohort participants randomly selected from 8 total vignettes. For each, the physicians assessed the individual's CHD risk and selected preferred therapies based on the individual's comorbidities, physical examination, and laboratory results. The individual's CHDRA score was then provided and the physicians were queried for changes to their initial treatment plans. Results After obtaining the CHDRA result, 70\% of the physician responses indicated a change to the patient's treatment plan. The revised lipid-management plans agreed more often (74.6\% of the time) with the current Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines than did the original plans (57.6\% of the time). Most physicians (71.3\%) agreed with the statement that the CHDRA result provided information that would impact their current treatment decisions. Conclusions The CHDRA test provided additional information to which physicians responded by more often applying appropriate therapy and actions aligned with guidelines, thus demonstrating the clinical utility of the test.},

In 10\%, pain was experienced in the neck with the initial typical orbitotemporal pain; in 37\%, pain radiated from the orbit or temple to the ipsilateral side of the neck. Sometimes, neck pain heralded the onset of the attack by a few minutes. During an attack, neck stiffness was reported in 40\% and tenderness in 29\%. Movement of the neck, especially flexion, precipitated cluster headache in 9\% of patients. This was particularly true of patients with chronic cluster headache. Neck movement aggravated the headache in 16 of 100 patients and an equal number reported amelioration of pain by neck movement, especially extension. The nuchal features did not necessarily accompany every attack and were usually overshadowed by the severity of the typical headache.

Therefore, we conducted a nationwide register-based cohort study in Sweden to investigate whether appendectomy is associated with altered risks of gastrointestinal cancers. Methods A population-based cohort study was conducted using the Swedish national registries, including 480,382 eligible patients followed during the period of 1970\textendash 2009 for the occurrence of site-specific gastrointestinal cancer (esophageal/gastric/colon/rectal cancer). Outcome and censoring information was collected by linkage to health and demography registers. We examined the incidence of appendectomy in Sweden using data from 1987\textendash 2009. We also calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) to estimate the relative gastrointestinal cancer risk through comparison to the general population. Results We noted an overall decrease in the age-standardized incidence of appendectomy among the entire Swedish population from 189.3 to 105.6 per 100,000 individuals between 1987 and 2009. Grouped by different discharge diagnosis, acute appendicitis, incidental appendectomy, and entirely negative appendectomy continuously decreased over the study period, while the perforation ratio (18\%\textendash 23\%) stayed relatively constant. Compared to the general population, no excess cancer risk was observed for gastrointestinal cancers under study with the exception of a marginally elevated risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma (SIR 1.32, 95\% CI 1.09\textendash 1.58). Conclusions In Sweden, the incidence of appendectomy and acute appendicitis has decreased during 1987\textendash 2009. No excess gastrointestinal cancer risks were observed among these appendectomized patients, with the possible exception of esophageal adenocarcinoma.},

We screened the apoB gene segment of codons 3448\textendash 3561 by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis in a total of 853 consecutively sampled German patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography for suspected CAD. By this, a new single base mutation was detected and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutation, CAC3543TAC results in a His3543Tyr substitution in apoB-100 (H3543Y). The prevalence of heterozygotes for H3543Y in the study population was 0.47\% compared to 0.12\% for the known Arg 3500 Gln (R3500Q) mutation. In conclusion, the new mutation is four times more frequent than ``classical'' FDB and thus appears to be the most common apoB mutation in Germany.},

Methods and Results\textemdash{} Cholesterol levels in the large and small LDL subfractions (termed LDL-C{$\geq$}260\AA{} and LDL-C{$<$}255\AA, respectively) were estimated from polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis of whole plasma in the cohort of 2072 men of the population-based Qu\'ebec Cardiovascular Study. All men were free of IHD at the baseline examination and followed-up for a period of 13 years, during which 262 first IHD events (coronary death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and unstable angina pectoris) were recorded. Our study confirmed the strong and independent association between LDL-C{$<$}255\AA{} levels as a proxy of the small dense LDL phenotype and the risk of IHD in men, particularly over the first 7 years of follow-up. However, elevated LDL-C{$\geq$}260\AA{} levels (third versus first tertile) were not associated with an increased risk of IHD over the 13-year follow-up (RR=0.76; P=0.07).

  abstract = {CONTEXT: The American Heart Association Nutrition Committee recommends women and men consume no more than 100 and 150 kcal of added sugar per day, respectively, whereas the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010, suggests a maximal added sugar intake of 25\% or less of total energy. OBJECTIVE: To address this discrepancy, we compared the effects of consuming glucose, fructose, or high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) at 25\% of energy requirements (E) on risk factors for cardiovascular disease. PARTICIPANTS, DESIGN AND SETTING, AND INTERVENTION: Forty-eight adults (aged 18-40 yr; body mass index 18-35 kg/m(2)) resided at the Clinical Research Center for 3.5 d of baseline testing while consuming energy-balanced diets containing 55\% E complex carbohydrate. For 12 outpatient days, they consumed usual ad libitum diets along with three servings per day of glucose, fructose, or HFCS-sweetened beverages (n = 16/group), which provided 25\% E requirements. Subjects then consumed energy-balanced diets containing 25\% E sugar-sweetened beverages/30\% E complex carbohydrate during 3.5 d of inpatient intervention testing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Twenty-four-hour triglyceride area under the curve, fasting plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and apolipoprotein B (apoB) concentrations were measured. RESULTS: Twenty-four-hour triglyceride area under the curve was increased compared with baseline during consumption of fructose (+4.7 {$\pm$} 1.2 mmol/liter \texttimes{} 24 h, P = 0.0032) and HFCS (+1.8 {$\pm$} 1.4 mmol/liter \texttimes{} 24 h, P = 0.035) but not glucose (-1.9 {$\pm$} 0.9 mmol/liter \texttimes{} 24 h, P = 0.14). Fasting LDL and apoB concentrations were increased during consumption of fructose (LDL: +0.29 {$\pm$} 0.082 mmol/liter, P = 0.0023; apoB: +0.093 {$\pm$} 0.022 g/liter, P = 0.0005) and HFCS (LDL: +0.42 {$\pm$} 0.11 mmol/liter, P {$<$} 0.0001; apoB: +0.12 {$\pm$} 0.031 g/liter, P {$<$} 0.0001) but not glucose (LDL: +0.012 {$\pm$} 0.071 mmol/liter, P = 0.86; apoB: +0.0097 {$\pm$} 0.019 g/liter, P = 0.90). CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of HFCS-sweetened beverages for 2 wk at 25\% E increased risk factors for cardiovascular disease comparably with fructose and more than glucose in young adults.},

The MRI findings were reviewed by 2 radiologists experienced in cardiac imaging, using the updated Lake Louise criteria. Serum markers of myocardial injury and inflammation (troponin-I, B-type natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), an electrocardiogram, transthoracic echocardiography, and relevant clinical data were obtained.COVID-19 infection, confirmed using reverse transcription\textendash polymerase chain reaction testing.Prevalence and severity of MRI findings consistent with myocarditis among young competitive athletes recovering from COVID-19.A total of 145 competitive student athletes (108 male and 37 female individuals; mean age, 20 years; range, 17-23 years) recovering from COVID-19 were included. Most patients had mild (71 [49.0\%]) or moderate (40 [27.6\%]) symptoms during the acute infection or were asymptomatic (24 [16.6\%]). Symptoms were not specified or documented in 10 patients (6.9\%). No patients required hospitalization. Cardiac MRIs were performed a median of 15 days (range, 11-194 days) after patients tested positive for COVID-19. Two patients had MRI findings consistent with myocarditis (1.4\% [95\% CI, 0.4\%-4.9\%]). Of these, 1 patient had marked nonischemic late gadolinium enhancement and T2-weighted signal abnormalities over multiple segments, along with an abnormal serum troponin-I level; the second patient had 1-cm nonischemic mild late gadolinium enhancement and mild T2-weighted signal abnormalities, with normal laboratory values.In this case series study, based on MRI findings, there was a low prevalence of myocarditis (1.4\%) among student athletes recovering from COVID-19 with no or mild to moderate symptoms. Thus, the utility of cardiac MRI as a screening tool for myocarditis in this patient population is questionable.},

Objective To increase the specificity of screening for lethal PCa at an early stage. Design, setting, and participants We conducted a case\textendash control study nested within a population-based cohort. PSA and three additional kallikreins were measured in cryopreserved blood from a population-based cohort in V\"asterbotten, Sweden. Of 40 379 men providing blood at ages 40, 50, and 60 yr from 1986 to 2009, 12 561 men were followed for {$>$}15 yr. From this cohort, the Swedish Cancer Registry identified 1423 incident PCa cases, 235 with distant metastasis. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Risk of distant metastasis for different PSA levels and a prespecified statistical model based on the four kallikrein markers. Results and limitations Most metastatic cases occurred in men with PSA in the top quartile at age 50 yr (69\%) or 60 yr (74\%), whereas 20-yr risk of metastasis for men with PSA below median was low ({$\leq$}0.6\%). Among men with PSA {$>$}2 ng/ml, a prespecified model based on four kallikrein markers significantly enhanced the prediction of metastasis compared with PSA alone. About half of all men with PSA {$>$}2 ng/ml were defined as low risk by this model and had a {$\leq$}1\% 15-yr risk of metastasis. Conclusions Screening at ages 50\textendash 60 yr should focus on men with PSA in the top quartile. A marker panel can aid biopsy decision making. Patient summary For men in their fifties, screening should focus on those in the top 10\% of PSA scores because close to half of subsequent cases of distant metastasis are found in this group. Testing of four kallikrein markers in men with an elevated PSA could aid biopsy decision making.},

What was needed was a well-designed, large-scale, long-term, double-blind study demonstrating a statistically significant impact of treatment on coronary heart disease events. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) had laid the groundwork for such a study as early as 1970, but the study was not completed and the results published until 1984. This study, the Coronary Primary Prevention Trial, showed that treatment with a bile acid binding resin reduced major coronary events in hypercholesterolemic men by 19\%, with a P value of 0.05. The NIH followed this up with a national Consensus Development Conference on Lowering Blood Cholesterol to Prevent Heart Disease. For the first time, the NIH now went on record advocating screening for hypercholesterolemia and urging aggressive treatment for those at high risk. The Institute initiated a national cooperative program to that end, the National Cholesterol Education Program. For the first time, preventing coronary heart disease became a national public health goal.},

Thirteen CrossFit-trained men (age = 28.5 \&plusmn; 6.6 years, experience = 49.2 \&plusmn; 36.3 months) were randomized in a double-blind, crossover design. Participants completed two sessions separated by a seven-day washout period, 60 min after consuming 5 mg/kg body mass of caffeine or a placebo. In each session, participants completed as many rounds as possible in 20 min of 5 pull-ups, 10 push-ups, and 15 air squats. CrossFit performance was the total number of repetitions completed in 20 min. Paired samples t-tests were used to compare CrossFit performance between caffeine and placebo conditions and to test for a potential learning effect between the first and second sessions. CrossFit performance was significantly higher during the caffeine condition compared to the placebo (461.4 \&plusmn; 103 vs. 425.0 \&plusmn; 93.5 repetitions, p \&lt; 0.05).

  abstract = {Behavioral phenotypes are generally complex, reflecting the action of multiple different genes. Nevertheless, there is growing evidence that key gene variants can alter activity within specific neuronal circuits and, therefore, influence particular cognitive-affective phenomena. One example is the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene, which has a common variant at codon 158. Those with valine (Val158) alleles have increased greater COMT activity and lower prefrontal extracellular dopamine compared with those with the methionine (Met158) substitution. Val158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in the processing of aversive stimuli (warrior strategy), while Met158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in memory and attention tasks (worrier strategy). Under conditions of increased dopamine release (eg, stress), individuals with Val158 alleles may have improved dopaminergic transmission and better performance, while individuals with Met158 alleles may have less efficient neurotransmission and worse performance. Some evidence suggests that Val158 alleles are associated with schizophrenia, while Met158 alleles are associated with anxiety.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the prostate specific antigen (PSA) density (PSAD) (the quotient of PSA and prostate volume) compared with the percent free PSA (\%fPSA) in different total PSA (tPSA) ranges from 2 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL. Possible cut-off levels depending on the tPSA should be established. METHODS: In total, 1809 men with no pretreatment of the prostate were enrolled between 1996 and 2004. Total and free PSA were measured with the IMMULITE PSA and Free PSA kits (Diagnostic Products, Los Angeles, CA). Prostate volume was determined by transrectal ultrasound. The diagnostic validity of tPSA, \%fPSA, and PSAD was evaluated by receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: The PSAD differed significantly (P {$<$} 0.0001) between patients with prostate carcinoma and patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia in all analyzed ranges of tPSA and prostate volume. At the 90\% and 95\% sensitivity levels and regarding the area under the ROC curve (AUC) within the tPSA range of 2-4 ng/mL, The PSAD was significantly better than tPSA and \%fPSA. Within the tPSA range of 4-10 ng/mL, the PSAD did not perform better than \%fPSA. CONCLUSIONS: PSAD showed a better performance than \%fPSA at tPSA concentrations {$<$} 4 ng/mL for detecting prostate carcinoma, with a significantly larger AUC for PSAD (0.739) compared with \%fPSA (0.667). PSAD did not perform better than \%fPSA when the tPSA range of 4-10 ng/mL was analyzed. Different PSAD cut-off values of 0.05 at tPSA 2-4 ng/mL, 0.1 at tPSA 4-10 ng/mL, and 0.19 at 10-20 ng/mL were necessary to reach 95\% sensitivity.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Subjects with lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] elevation have increased arterial wall inflammation and cardiovascular risk. In patients at increased cardiovascular risk, arterial wall inflammation is reduced following lipid-lowering therapy by statin treatment or lipoprotein apheresis. However, it is unknown whether lipid-lowering treatment in elevated Lp(a) subjects alters arterial wall inflammation. We evaluated whether evolocumab, which lowers both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and Lp(a), attenuates arterial wall inflammation in patients with elevated Lp(a). METHODS AND RESULTS: In this multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 129 patients \{median [interquartile range (IQR)]: age 60.0 [54.0-67.0] years, Lp(a) 200.0 [155.5-301.5] nmol/L [80.0 (62.5-121.0) mg/dL]; mean [standard deviation (SD)] LDL-C 3.7 [1.0] mmol/L [144.0 (39.7) mg/dL]; National Cholesterol Education Program high risk, 25.6\%\} were randomized to monthly subcutaneous evolocumab 420\,mg or placebo. Compared with placebo, evolocumab reduced LDL-C by 60.7\% [95\% confidence interval (CI) 65.8-55.5] and Lp(a) by 13.9\% (95\% CI 19.3-8.5). Among evolocumab-treated patients, the Week 16 mean (SD) LDL-C level was 1.6 (0.7) mmol/L [60.1 (28.1) mg/dL], and the median (IQR) Lp(a) level was 188.0 (140.0-268.0) nmol/L [75.2 (56.0-107.2) mg/dL]. Arterial wall inflammation [most diseased segment target-to-background ratio (MDS TBR)] in the index vessel (left carotid, right carotid, or thoracic aorta) was assessed by 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron-emission tomography/computed tomography. Week 16 index vessel MDS TBR was not significantly altered with evolocumab (-8.3\%) vs. placebo (-5.3\%) [treatment difference -3.0\% (95\% CI -7.4\% to 1.4\%); P\,=\,0.18]. CONCLUSION: Evolocumab treatment in patients with median baseline Lp(a) 200.0\,nmol/L led to a large reduction in LDL-C and a small reduction in Lp(a), resulting in persistent elevated Lp(a) levels. The latter may have contributed to the unaltered arterial wall inflammation.},

One only has to refer to the numerous published case reports to gain an appreciation of the dramatic consequences of HoFH. Patients typically experience a first major cardiovascular event during adolescence or early adulthood, and cholesterol levels can be elevated to such an extent that depositions in the form of xanthomata may already be present at birth.1 Large variation in the phenotypical expression of HoFH does exist, and cases of death and the need for major cardiovascular surgery during early childhood have been described.2 The implementation of screening programmes for FH and advances in genetics have revealed that HoFH is three- to four-fold more common than the traditional estimate of one in a million.3 However, much higher rates of up to 1:30\,000 have been reported in some populations due to founder effects and consanguinity.3},

To study disease course and outcome, we prospectively followed 12 patients who presented to our tertiary referral neuromuscular outpatient clinic between January 2003 and January 2004. Medical history, neurological, laboratory and electrophysiological examinations were obtained from all patients. All patients were reviewed a second time in 2007, and five had a follow-up electrophysiological examination. At the first visit, 50\% described an episode of stretching preceding the sensory complaints. All but three described pain in the affected area before or concomitant with sensory loss. At clinical examination a median of six skin areas were affected, and in 75\% this could be confirmed by nerve conduction studies in at least one nerve. Forty-two percent had involvement of the trigeminal nerve. After a mean disease duration of 7.5~years, three patients reported a complete disappearance of sensory complaints and five that the pain had disappeared, but numbness remained. Three patients still had both painful and numb sensory deficits. One patient developed a distal symmetric sensory polyneuropathy. In conclusion, Wartenberg's sensory neuritis is a distinct, exclusively sensory, neuropathy, marked by pain preceding numbness in affected nerves. An episode of stretching preceding pain is not necessary for the diagnosis. Wartenberg's sensory neuritis often retains its spotty, exclusively sensory characteristics after long term follow-up.},

The Australasian Menopause Society, the British Menopause Society, European Menopause and Andropause Society, the European Society of Endocrinology, and the International Menopause Society (co-sponsors of the guideline) reviewed and commented on the draft.Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms and other symptoms of the climacteric. Benefits may exceed risks for the majority of symptomatic postmenopausal women who are under age 60 or under 10 years since the onset of menopause. Health care professionals should individualize therapy based on clinical factors and patient preference. They should screen women before initiating MHT for cardiovascular and breast cancer risk and recommend the most appropriate therapy depending on risk/benefit considerations. Current evidence does not justify the use of MHT to prevent coronary heart disease, breast cancer, or dementia. Other options are available for those with vasomotor symptoms who prefer not to use MHT or who have contraindications because these patients should not use MHT. Low-dose vaginal estrogen and ospemifene provide effective therapy for the genitourinary syndrome of menopause, and vaginal moisturizers and lubricants are available for those not choosing hormonal therapy. All postmenopausal women should embrace appropriate lifestyle measures.},

Facts showed: (i) normal tunica intima invariably consists of multiple cellular layers; and (ii) initial lipid depositions occurred in the deepest layers of tunica intima.

  abstract = {Benefits associated with lowered serum DHT levels after 5{$\alpha$}-reductase inhibitor (5AR-I) therapy in men have contributed to a misconception that circulating DHT levels are an important stimulus for androgenic action in target tissues (e.g., prostate). Yet evidence from clinical studies indicates that intracellular concentrations of androgens (particularly in androgen-sensitive tissues) are essentially independent of circulating levels. To assess the clinical significance of modest elevations in serum DHT and the DHT/testosterone (T) ratio observed in response to common T replacement therapy, a comprehensive review of the published literature was performed to identify relevant data. Although the primary focus of this review is about DHT in men, we also provide a brief overview of DHT in women. The available published data are limited by the lack of large, well-controlled studies of long duration that are sufficiently powered to expose subtle safety signals. Nonetheless, the preponderance of available clinical data indicates that modest elevations in circulating levels of DHT in response to androgen therapy should not be of concern in clinical practice. Elevated DHT has not been associated with increased risk of prostate disease (e.g., cancer or benign hyperplasia) nor does it appear to have any systemic effects on cardiovascular disease safety parameters (including increased risk of polycythemia) beyond those commonly observed with available T preparations. Well-controlled, long-term studies of transdermal DHT preparations have failed to identify safety signals unique to markedly elevated circulating DHT concentrations or signals materially different from T., Circulating levels of DHT in response to testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) do not correlate with those found in androgen sensitive tissue due to homeostatic control of intracellular DHT.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phenotype of autosomal recessive hypercholesterolaemia (ARH), a rare lipid disorder, is known to be milder than that of homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) with LDL receptor gene mutation. However, few data exist regarding the functional differences in ARH and FH particularly in terms of remnant-like particles' (RLP) metabolism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood sampling was performed up to 6h after OFTT cream loading (50 g/body surface area) with 2-h intervals in a single ARH proband, four heterozygous FH patients with LDL receptor gene mutation and four normal controls. Plasma lipoprotein and RLP fraction were determined by HPLC system. The area under curve (AUC) of each lipoprotein including RLP fractions was evaluated. RESULTS: The AUC of TG, RLP cholesterol (RLP-C) and RLP triglyceride (RLP-TG) levels of heterozygous FH subjects was significantly higher than those of controls (466{$\pm$}71 mg/dL\texttimes h vs. 303{$\pm$}111 mg/dL\texttimes h, P{$<$}0{$\cdot$}05; 35{$\pm$}7 mg/dL\texttimes h vs. 21{$\pm$}8 mg/dL\texttimes h, P{$<$}0{$\cdot$}05; 124{$\pm$}57 mg/dL\texttimes h vs. 51{$\pm$}13 mg/dL\texttimes h, P{$<$}0{$\cdot$}05, respectively). Under these conditions, those values of ARH were close to those of controls (310 mg/dL\texttimes h, 22 mg/dL\texttimes h, 23 mg/dL\texttimes h, respectively). CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that unlike in FH, RLP clearance is preserved in ARH. The preservation of post-prandial RLP clearance may contribute to the mild phenotype of ARH compared with FH.},

  abstract = {Background A relatively high mortality of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is worrying, the application of heparin in COVID-19 has been recommended by some expert consensus due to the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation and venous thromboembolism. However, its efficacy remains to be validated. Methods Coagulation results, medications and outcomes of consecutive patients being classified as severe COVID-19 in Tongji hospital were retrospectively analysed. The 28-day mortality between heparin users and nonusers were compared, also in different risk of coagulopaphy which was stratified by the sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) score or D-dimer result. Results There were 449 patients with severe COVID-19 enrolled into the study, 99 of them received heparin (mainly with low molecular weight heparin, LMWH) for 7 days or longer. The D-dimer, prothrombin time and age were positively, and platelet count was negatively, correlated with 28-day mortality in multivariate analysis. No difference on 28-day mortality was found between heparin users and nonusers (30.3\% vs 29.7\%, P=0.910). But the 28-day mortality of heparin users were lower than nonusers In patients with SIC score {$\geq$}4 (40.0\% vs 64.2\%, P=0.029), or D-dimer {$>$} 6 fold of upper limit of normal (32.8\% vs 52.4\%, P=0.017). Conclusions Anticoagulant therapy mainly with LMWH appears to be associated with better prognosis in severe COVID-19 patients meeting SIC criteria or with markedly elevated D-dimer.},

Design Multicentre, open label, randomised controlled trial. Setting 16 government designated covid-19 treatment centres in China, 11 to 29 February 2020. Participants 150 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed covid-19 were included in the intention to treat analysis (75 patients assigned to hydroxychloroquine plus standard of care, 75 to standard of care alone). Interventions Hydroxychloroquine administrated at a loading dose of 1200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintenance dose of 800 mg daily (total treatment duration: two or three weeks for patients with mild to moderate or severe disease, respectively). Main outcome measure Negative conversion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by 28 days, analysed according to the intention to treat principle. Adverse events were analysed in the safety population in which hydroxychloroquine recipients were participants who received at least one dose of hydroxychloroquine and hydroxychloroquine non-recipients were those managed with standard of care alone. Results Of 150 patients, 148 had mild to moderate disease and two had severe disease. The mean duration from symptom onset to randomisation was 16.6 (SD 10.5; range 3-41) days. A total of 109 (73\%) patients (56 standard of care; 53 standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine) had negative conversion well before 28 days, and the remaining 41 (27\%) patients (19 standard of care; 22 standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine) were censored as they did not reach negative conversion of virus. The probability of negative conversion by 28 days in the standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine group was 85.4\% (95\% confidence interval 73.8\% to 93.8\%), similar to that in the standard of care group (81.3\%, 71.2\% to 89.6\%). The difference between groups was 4.1\% (95\% confidence interval \textendash 10.3\% to 18.5\%). In the safety population, adverse events were recorded in 7/80 (9\%) hydroxychloroquine non-recipients and in 21/70 (30\%) hydroxychloroquine recipients. The most common adverse event in the hydroxychloroquine recipients was diarrhoea, reported in 7/70 (10\%) patients. Two hydroxychloroquine recipients reported serious adverse events. Conclusions Administration of hydroxychloroquine did not result in a significantly higher probability of negative conversion than standard of care alone in patients admitted to hospital with mainly persistent mild to moderate covid-19. Adverse events were higher in hydroxychloroquine recipients than in non-recipients. Trial registration ChiCTR2000029868.},

Individual subjects were randomly assigned to one of three protein intakes: low protein (LP) = 0.86 g protein.kg-1.day-1, moderate protein (MP) = 1.40 g protein.kg-1.day-1, or high protein (HP) = 2.40 g protein.kg-1.day-1 for 13 days for each dietary treatment. NBAL was measured and whole body protein synthesis (WBPS) and leucine oxidation were determined from L-[1\textendash 13C]leucine turnover. NBAL data were used to determine that the protein intake for zero NBAL for S was 0.69 g.kg-1.day-1 and for SA was 1.41 g.kg-1.day-1. A suggested recommended intake for S was 0.89 g.kg-1.day-1 and for SA was 1.76 g.kg-1.day-1. For SA, the LP diet did not provide adequate protein and resulted in an accommodated state (decreased WBPS vs. MP and HP), and the MP diet resulted in a state of adaptation [increase in WBPS (vs. LP) and no change in leucine oxidation (vs. LP)]. The HP diet did not result in increased WBPS compared with the MP diet, but leucine oxidation did increase significantly, indicating a nutrient overload. For S the LP diet provided adequate protein, and increasing protein intake did not increase WBPS. On the HP diet leucine oxidation increased for S. These results indicated that the MP and HP diets were nutrient overloads for S. There were no effects of varying protein intake on indexes of lean body mass (creatinine excretion, body density) for either group. In summary, protein requirements for athletes performing strength training are greater than for sedentary individuals and are above current Canadian and US recommended daily protein intake requirements for young healthy males.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reducing high blood cholesterol, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in people with and without a past history of coronary heart disease (CHD) is an important goal of pharmacotherapy. Statins are the first-choice agents. Previous reviews of the effects of statins have highlighted their benefits in people with coronary artery disease. The case for primary prevention, however, is less clear. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects, both harms and benefits, of statins in people with no history of CVD. SEARCH STRATEGY: To avoid duplication of effort, we checked reference lists of previous systematic reviews. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 1, 2007), MEDLINE (2001 to March 2007) and EMBASE (2003 to March 2007). There were no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of statins with minimum duration of one year and follow-up of six months, in adults with no restrictions on their total low density lipoprotein (LDL) or high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and where 10\% or less had a history of CVD, were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes included all cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events, combined endpoints (fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events), change in blood total cholesterol concentration, revascularisation, adverse events, quality of life and costs. Relative risk (RR) was calculated for dichotomous data, and for continuous data pooled weighted mean differences (with 95\% confidence intervals) were calculated. MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen randomised control trials (16 trial arms; 34,272 participants) were included. Eleven trials recruited patients with specific conditions (raised lipids, diabetes, hypertension, microalbuminuria). All-cause mortality was reduced by statins (RR 0.83, 95\% CI 0.73 to 0.95) as was combined fatal and non-fatal CVD endpoints (RR 0.70, 95\% CI 0.61 to 0.79). Benefits were also seen in the reduction of revascularisation rates (RR 0.66, 95\% CI 0.53 to 0.83). Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were reduced in all trials but there was evidence of heterogeneity of effects. There was no clear evidence of any significant harm caused by statin prescription or of effects on patient quality of life. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Although reductions in all-cause mortality, composite endpoints and revascularisations were found with no excess of adverse events, there was evidence of selective reporting of outcomes, failure to report adverse events and inclusion of people with cardiovascular disease. Only limited evidence showed that primary prevention with statins may be cost effective and improve patient quality of life. Caution should be taken in prescribing statins for primary prevention among people at low cardiovascular risk.},

Here, we review the precedent for passive immunization and lessons learned from using antibody therapies for viral infections such as respiratory syncytial virus, Ebola virus and SARS-CoV infections. We then focus on the deployment of convalescent plasma and neutralizing mAbs for treatment of SARS-CoV-2. We review specific clinical questions, including the rationale for stratification of patients, potential biomarkers, known risk factors and temporal considerations for optimal clinical use. To answer these questions, there is a need to understand factors such as the kinetics of viral load and its correlation with clinical outcomes, endogenous antibody responses, pharmacokinetic properties of neutralizing mAbs and the potential benefit of combining antibodies to defend against emerging viral variants.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ever-increasing prevalence of obesity constitutes a major health problem worldwide. A subgroup of obese individuals has been described as "metabolically healthy obese" (MHO). In contrast to metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO), the MHO phenotype has a favorable risk profile. Despite this, the MHO phenotype is still sub-optimally characterized with respect to a comprehensive risk assessment. Our aim was to increase the understanding of metabolic alterations associated with healthy and unhealthy obesity. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, men and women (18-70\,years) with obesity (body mass index (BMI)\,{$\geq$}\,30\,kg/m2) or normal weight (NW) (BMI\,{$\leq$}\,25\,kg/m2) were classified with MHO (n\,=\,9), MUO (n\,=\,10) or NW (n\,=\,11) according to weight, lipid profile and glycemic regulation. We characterized individuals by comprehensive metabolic profiling using a commercial available high-throughput proton NMR metabolomics platform. Plasma fatty acid profile, including short chain fatty acids, was measured using gas chromatography. RESULTS: The concentrations of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) subclasses were overall significantly higher, and high density lipoprotein (HDL) subclasses lower in MUO compared with MHO. VLDL and IDL subclasses were significantly lower and HDL subclasses were higher in NW compared with MHO. The concentration of isoleucine, leucine and valine was significantly higher in MUO compared with MHO, and the concentration phenylalanine was lower in NW subjects compared with MHO. The fatty acid profile in MHO was overall more favorable compared with MUO. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive metabolic profiling supports that MHO subjects have intermediate-stage cardiovascular disease risk marker profile compared with NW and MUO subjects.

However, subsets of both female and male athletes are at increased risk of impaired bone health and bone stress injuries. The Female Athlete Triad (Triad) is defined as the interrelationship of low energy availability (with or without disordered eating), menstrual dysfunction, and low bone mineral density. The Triad may result in health consequences, including bone stress injuries. Our review presents evidence that an analogous process may occur in male athletes. Our review of the available literature indicates that a subset of male athletes may experience adverse health issues that parallel those associated with the Triad, including low energy availability (with or without disordered eating), hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and low bone mineral density. Consequently, male athletes may be predisposed to developing bone stress injuries, and these injuries can be the first presenting feature of associated Triad conditions. We discuss the evidence for impaired nutrition, hormonal dysfunction, and low bone mineral density in a subset of male athletes, and how these health issues may parallel those of the Triad. With further research into the mechanisms and outcomes of these health concerns in active and athletic men, evidence-based guidelines can be developed that result in best practice.},

One possible answer is antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 due to prior exposure to other coronaviruses. ADE modulates the immune response and can elicit sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or cytokine storm, one or all of which have been documented in severe cases and deaths. ADE also requires prior exposure to similar antigenic epitopes, presumably circulating in local viruses, making it a possible explanation for the observed geographic limitation of severe cases and deaths.},

Objective: The aim of this review is to summarize the role of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type- 9(PCSK9) in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and discuss the effects of the new hypolipidaemic drugs PCSK9 inhibitors on NAFLD. Results: Data indicates that high intrahepatic or circulating PCSK9 levels increase muscle and liver lipid storage, adipose energy storage and hepatic fatty acids, as well as triglycerides storage and secretion, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of NAFLD. The findings of animal and human studies, aiming to reduce PCSK9 with inhibitors (human IGG antibodies, antisense particles against PCSK9 mRNA, and small anti PCSK9 antibodies) point towards liver protection from NAFLD through inhibition of PCSK9 expression in the induction of degradation of hepatic HNF1a protein, insulin resistance (IR), and other mechanisms. Conclusions: The use of PCSK9 inhibitors ameliorates NAFLD, aside from beneficial effects on CVD and independently of low density lipoprotein cholesterol level reduction.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between positional blood pressure change and 8-year incidence of hypertension in a biracial cohort of young adults. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Participants from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study with complete data from year 2 (1987-1988), year 5 (1990-1991), year 7 (1992-1993), and year 10 (1995-1996) examinations were included (N = 2781). Participants were classified into 3 groups based on their year 2 systolic blood pressure response to standing: drop, a decrease in systolic blood pressure of more than 5 mm Hg; same, a change of between -5 and +5 mm Hg; and rise, more than 5-mm Hg increase. RESULTS: The number of participants in each group was as follows: drop, 741; same, 1590; and rise, 450. The 8-year incidence of hypertension was 8.4\% in the drop group, 6.8\% in the same group, and 12.4\% in the rise group (P {$<$} .001). Adjusted odds ratios for developing hypertension during the follow-up period in the rise group vs the same group were as follows: in black men, 2.85 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.43-5.69), in black women, 2.47 (95\% CI, 1.19-5.11), in white men, 2.17 (95\% CI, 1.00-4.73), and in white women, 4.74 (95\% CI, 1.11-20.30). CONCLUSIONS: A greater than 5-mm Hg increase in blood pressure on standing identified a group of young adults at increased risk of developing hypertension within 8 years. These findings support a physiologic link between sympathetic nervous system reactivity and risk of hypertension in young adults.},

Many forms of lipid-lowering therapies have been used in the past, but definitive evidence of benefit has been lacking. We therefore undertook a retrospective survey of lipid levels and clinical outcomes of FH homozygotes treated with a combination of lipid-lowering measures between 1990 and 2014 in South Africa and the UK. Methods and results: We divided 133 previously statin-naive homozygotes into quartiles according to their on-treatment levels of serum cholesterol and compared the occurrence of any death, cardiovascular death, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) between the quartiles during 25\,years of follow-up, using Cox and competing risks regression analysis. Patients in Quartile 4, with an on-treatment serum cholesterol {$>$}15.1\,mmol/L, had a hazard ratio of 11.5 for any death compared with those in Quartile 1, with an on-treatment cholesterol of\,{$<$}\,8.1\,mmol/L. Those in Quartiles 2 and 3 combined, with on-treatment cholesterol of 8.1-15.1\,mmol/L had a hazard ratio of 3.6 compared with Quartile 1. These differences were statistically significant (P\,{$<$}\,0.001) and remained so after adjustments for confounding factors (P\,=\,0.04). Significant differences between quartiles were also evident for cardiovascular deaths and MACE. Conclusion: These findings provide unequivocal evidence that the extent of reduction of serum cholesterol achieved by a combination of therapeutic measures, including statins, ezetimibe, lipoprotein apheresis, and evolocumab, is a major determinant of survival in homozygous FH.},

ApoB-100 kinetics in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs), lbLDL (density [d] = 1.019\textendash 1.044 g/ml), and sdLDL (d = 1.044\textendash 1.063 g/ml) were determined in the fed state by using stable isotope tracers, mass spectrometry, and compartmental modeling. Compared with placebo, rosuvastatin decreased LDL cholesterol and apoB-100 levels in TRL, lbLDL, and sdLDL by significantly increasing the fractional catabolic rate of apoB-100 (TRL, +45\%; lbLDL, +131\%; and sdLDL, +97\%), without a change in production. On placebo, 25\% of TRL apoB-100 was catabolized directly, 37\% was converted to lbLDL, and 38\% went directly to sdLDL; rosuvastatin did not alter these distributions. During both phases, sdLDL apoB-100 was catabolized more slowly than lbLDL apoB-100 (P {$<$} 0.01). Proteomic analysis indicated that rosuvastatin decreased apoC-III and apoM content within the density range of lbLDL (P {$<$} 0.05). In our view, sdLDL is more atherogenic than lbLDL because of its longer plasma residence time, potentially resulting in more particle oxidation, modification, and reduction in size, with increased arterial wall uptake. Rosuvastatin enhances the catabolism of apoB-100 in both lbLDL and sdLDL.},

The antibody works against the GAD enzyme, which is essential in the formation of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter found in the brain. Patients found with this antibody present with motor and cognitive problems due to low levels or lack of GABA, because in the absence or low levels of GABA patients exhibit motor and cognitive symptoms. The anti-GAD antibody is found in some neurological syndromes, including stiff-person syndrome, paraneoplastic stiff-person syndrome, Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), limbic encephalopathy, cerebellar ataxia, eye movement disorders, and epilepsy. Previously, excluding MFS, these conditions were called `hyperexcitability disorders'. However, collectively, these syndromes should be known as ``anti-GAD positive neurological syndromes.'' An important limitation of this study is that the literature is lacking on the subject, and why patients with the above mentioned neurological problems present with different symptoms has not been studied in detail. Therefore, it is recommended that more research is conducted on this subject to obtain a better and deeper understanding of these anti-GAD antibody induced neurological syndromes.},

Participants and Methods This is a secondary analysis of data from a prospective, multi-ethnic, population-based cohort study designed to study subclinical atherosclerosis. A total of 6809 persons aged 45 to 84 years old without known cardiovascular disease at baseline were enrolled from July 2000-September 2002. All participants had CAC scoring performed, and were followed up for a median of 8.5 years. The main outcome measures studied were CHD events, defined as myocardial infarction, definite angina or probable angina followed by revascularization, resuscitated cardiac arrest or death attributable to coronary heart disease. Results Comparing individuals with CAC=0 to those with CAC {$>$} 100, there was an increased incidence of CHD events from 1 to 21/1000 person-years, and 2 to 23/1000 person-years in the 45-54 and 75-84 year old age groups respectively. Compared to CAC=0, CAC 1-100 and CAC {$>$}100 impart an increased multi-variable adjusted CHD event risk in both the 45-54 and 75-84 year old age groups [HR (95\% CI): 45-54 years old, CAC 1-100: 2.3 (0.9-5.8), CAC{$>$}100: 12.4 (5.1-30.0); 75-84 years old, CAC 1-100: 5.4 (1.2-23.8), CAC{$>$}100: 12.1 (2.9-50.2)]. Conclusions Increased CAC imparts an increased CHD risk in younger and elderly individuals, suggesting that once CAC is known chronologic age has less importance. The utility of CAC scoring as a risk-stratification tool extends both to younger and elderly patients.},

As reaffirmed by the recent MERS outbreak in South Korea, highly pathogenic coronaviruses are capable of causing epidemics affecting hundreds of individuals as a result of sustained person-to-person transmission in nosocomial settings that can be linked to a single traveler who became an index patient (2). Currently, the best public health strategy to circumvent sustained coronavirus transmission in an outbreak situation is to quarantine individuals who have a history of contact with confirmed cases of MERS. In the most recent outbreak in South Korea, this led to the isolation and monitoring of more than 16,000 individuals, a feat that may not be economically or logistically feasible \ldots},

  abstract = {Introduction In Haglund syndrome, standard radiologic measurements lack specificity and reliability in assessing etiologic morphologic calcaneal abnormalities. We report a simple X/Y ratio to measure posterior calcaneal length, where X is calcaneal length on lateral weight-bearing view and Y is greater tuberosity length. Objective To compare this new parameter against the radiologic gold standard in a group of Haglund patients and a healthy control group. Hypothesis Measuring this ratio significantly distinguishes between Haglund patients and healthy subjects. Material and methods A retrospective study included 50 Haglund syndrome patients and 30 healthy controls. Standard measurements (Fowler-Philipangle, Chauveaux-Liet angle, Ruch pitch, Heneghan-Pavlov test) and X/Y ratio were calculated twice by 2 independent observers. Intra- and inter-observer correlations were calculated, as were the specificity and sensitivity of the various parameters, with a ROC curve to establish the X/Y threshold. Results All measurements were reproducible on intra- and inter-observer testing. There were no significant inter-group differences in standard measurement specificity or sensitivity. The Haglund group showed significantly lower X/Y ratio (2.07) than controls (2.70; p{$<$}0.0001), with a cut-off at 2.5. Threshold sensitivity in confirming Haglund syndrome was 100\% (p{$<$}0.0001) and specificity 95\% (p{$<$}0.0001). Discussion This new parameter measures the length of the calcaneus and its greater tuberosity. It is more reliable and reproducible in terms of sensitivity and specificity than standard measurements in Haglund syndrome. The 2.5 ratio threshold can guide surgical decision-making.

  abstract = {Previous results from this laboratory found that the arterial low-density lipoprotein (LDL) residence time in lesion-prone aortic sites was longer in hyperlipidemic rabbits before lesion formation than in the corresponding sites in normolipidemic rabbits. The calculation of residence time in the previous study assumed that the arterial wall was homogeneous; the present study reexamines the issue using a method that does not require such an assumption. The concentration of radiolabeled arterial LDL was measured in New Zealand White rabbits killed at several different times (0.5 to 72 hours) after injection of labeled LDL. Using a stochastic analysis, arterial LDL residence time was calculated from the pooled labeled arterial LDL measurements from these rabbits. In these studies, the arterial LDL residence times in normolipidemic and hyperlipidemic rabbits before lesion formation were similar in both the lesion-prone and -resistant sites. However, immediately upon development of early fatty streak lesions, the arterial LDL residence time increased dramatically. After only 16 days of cholesterol feeding, the residence time was 10 times longer in the lesioned aortic arch compared with similar tissue from normolipidemic rabbits (4 to 45 hours). After 21 days of cholesterol feeding, the residence time of LDL in the lesioned aortic arch increased to {$>$}25-fold that of normolipidemic tissue. Similar results were observed in the lesioned tissue of the abdominal branchings. This early retention of LDL suggests that significant changes are taking place within the arterial wall during this critical stage of early lesion development.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oxidized phospholipids (OxPL) are present within atherosclerotic plaques and bound by lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] in plasma. This study evaluated the impact of atorvastatin on oxidized LDL (OxLDL) in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). METHODS AND RESULTS: OxLDL-E06 (OxPL content on apolipoprotein B-100 [apoB] detected by antibody E06), apoB-100 immune complexes (apoB-IC), OxLDL autoantibodies, and Lp(a) levels were measured in 2341 patients at baseline and after 16 weeks of treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg/d or placebo. The OxLDL-E06 and apoB-IC data are reported per apoB-100 particle (OxPL/apoB, IC/apoB) and as total levels on all apoB-100 particles (total apoB-OxPL and total apoB-IC [eg, OxPL/apoB or IC/apoBxapoB-100 levels]). Compared with baseline values, atorvastatin reduced apoB-100 (-33\%), total apoB-OxPL (-29.7\%), total apoB-IC IgG (-29.5\%), and IgM (-25.7\%) (P{$<$}0.0001 for all), whereas no change or an increase was observed with placebo. When normalized per apoB-100, compared with placebo, atorvastatin increased OxPL/apoB (9.5\% versus -3.9\%, P{$<$}0.0001) and Lp(a) (8.8\% versus -0.7\%, (P{$<$}0.0001). A strong correlation was noted between OxPL/apoB and Lp(a) (R=0.85, P{$<$}0.0001), consistent with previous data that Lp(a) binds OxPL. CONCLUSIONS: After atorvastatin treatment, total OxPL on all apoB-100 particles was decreased. However, there was enrichment of OxPL on a smaller pool of apoB-100 particles, in parallel with similar increases in Lp(a), suggesting binding by Lp(a). These data support the hypothesis that atorvastatin promotes mobilization and clearance of proinflammatory OxPL, which may contribute to a reduction in ischemic events after ACS.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is reported as Lp(a) particle mass (mg/dL) or molar concentration of apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] (nmol/L), which is considered the gold standard. Values are often converted from one measurement to the other but the validity of this is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the relationship between Lp(a) molar concentration and Lp(a) mass in the context of various Lp(a) level thresholds and apo(a) isoform size. METHODS: In all samples, Lp(a) levels in molar concentration and apo(a) isoform size were determined at the Northwest Lipid Metabolism and Diabetes Research Laboratories (NLMDRL). Lp(a) mass levels were determined at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) (1635 samples), by 5 commercially available assays: Denka 1 and Denka 2 (each 80 samples), 2 turbidimetric assays (2545 and 2673 samples, respectively), and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (2605 samples). The ratios between Lp(a) molar concentration and mass (eg, nmol/L/mg/dL) were calculated and related to apo(a) isoform size. RESULTS: The mean (SD) ratios for NLMDRL/UCSD, NLMDRL/Denka1, and NLMDRL/Denka2 were 2.42 (1.25), 1.64 (0.18), and 2.02 (0.22), respectively. The ratios for NLMDRL/UCSD, NLMDRL/Denka1, and NLMDRL/Denka2 increased by Lp(a) cutoffs, with ratios of 1.82, 1.52, and 1.87, respectively, for Lp(a)~{$<~$}75~nmol/L and 2.80, 1.89, and 2.24, respectively, for Lp(a)~{$>~$}125~nmol/L. For the commercial turbidimetric assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the ratios ranged from {$<$}1 to {$>$}5. CONCLUSIONS: Lp(a) molar/mass ratios are threshold, method, and isoform dependent. A single conversion factor between assays is not appropriate. These data support the transition of Lp(a) mass assays to molar concentration to improve diagnostic and clinical interpretation of Lp(a)-mediated risk.},

Background: OSEs are immunogenic, proinflammatory, and proatherogenic. The long-term predictive value and net reclassification of OSEs for risk of CVD events are not known. Methods: Oxidized phospholipids on apolipoprotein B-100 (OxPL/apoB) and immunoglobulin (Ig)-G (IgG) and IgM autoantibodies to malondialdehyde-modified, low-density lipoprotein (MDA-LDL) and copper-oxidized LDL (Cu-OxLDL) were measured in 765 subjects in 1995 and 656 subjects in 2000 in the Bruneck study, representing 45- to 84-year-old men and women from the general community. Results: Over 15 years of follow-up, 138 subjects reached the primary endpoint of incident CVD (ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, new-onset unstable angina, acute coronary interventions, and vascular death). In a multivariable Cox model, the highest tertile of OxPL/apoB was associated with higher risk of CVD (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.4; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5 to 3.7) and stroke (HR: 3.6; 95\% CI: 1.8 to 7.4) compared with the lowest tertile. IgG Cu-OxLDLs were associated with higher risk of CVD, whereas IgM MDA-LDLs were associated with lower risk. Using OxPL/apoB, IgG Cu-OxLDL, and IgM MDA-LDL variables, the area under the curve (AUC) for CVD risk prediction increased from 0.664 (95\% CI: 0.629 to 0.697) to 0.705 (95\% CI: 0.672 to 0.737) (p = 0.048). The net reclassification index (NRI) was 0.163 (p = 0.0044) and 0.332 (p \textbackslash textless 0.0001) in all subjects (n = 765) and in subjects with intermediate risk (n = 305), respectively. Of 627 subjects who remained free of CVD, 108 were correctly reclassified to a lower risk category, and 83 were reclassified to a higher category (categories: 15-year risk \textbackslash textless15\%, 15\% to 30\%, \textbackslash textgreater30\%). Conclusions: OSE biomarkers predict 15-year CVD and stroke outcomes and provide potential clinical utility by reclassifying a significant proportion of individuals into higher or lower risk categories after traditional risk assessment. \textcopyright{} 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

Although physical examination may reveal Achilles tendon xanthomas (ATX), there are several imaging methods for their detection. It is worth mentioning that ultrasonography is the method of choice in everyday clinical practice. Although several treatments for Achilles tendon xanthomas (ATX) have been proposed (LDL apheresis, statins, etc.), they target mostly in the treatment of the basic metabolic disorder of lipid metabolism, which is the main cause of these lesions.

In mammals, the pattern of gonadotropin secretion includes both pulse and surge phases, which are regulated independently. The pulsatile release of GnRH and LH plays an important role in the development of sexual function and in the normal regulation of the menstrual cycle. The importance of GnRH pulsatility was established in a series of classic studies. Fertility is impaired when GnRH pulsatility is inhibited by chronic malnutrition, excessive caloric expenditure, or aging. A number of reproductive disorders in women with including hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, hypothlamic amenorrhea, hyperprolactinemia and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are also associated with disruption of the normal pulsatile GnRH secretion. Despite these findings, the molecular mechanisms of this pulsatile GnRH regulation are not well understood.

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to record the blood pressure response to heavy weight-lifting exercise in five experienced body builders. Blood pressure was directly recorded by means of a capacitance transducer connected to a catheter in the brachial artery. Intrathoracic pressure with the Valsalva maneuver was recorded as mouth pressure by having the subject maintain an open glottis while expiring against a column of Hg during the lifts. Exercises included single-arm curls, overhead presses, and both double- and single-leg presses performed to failure at 80, 90, 95, and 100\% of maximum. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures rose rapidly to extremely high values during the concentric contraction phase for each lift and declined with the eccentric contraction. The greatest peak pressures occurred during the double-leg press where the mean value for the group was 320/250 mmHg, with pressures in one subject exceeding 480/350 mmHg. Peak pressures with the single-arm curl exercise reached a mean group value of 255/190 mmHg when repetitions were continued to failure. Mouth pressures of 30-50 Torr during a single maximum lift, or as subjects approached failure with a submaximal weight, indicate that a portion of the observed increase in blood pressure was caused by a Valsalva maneuver. It was concluded that when healthy young subjects perform weight-lifting exercises the mechanical compression of blood vessels combines with a potent pressor response and a Valsalva response to produce extreme elevations in blood pressure. Pressures are extreme even when exercise is performed with a relatively small muscle mass.},

In subjects with atherosclerosis, intimal thickness and area stenosis averaged 1.08{$\pm$}0.48 mm and 32.7{$\pm$}15.9\%, respectively. For all age groups, the average intimal thickness was greater in men than women, although the prevalence of atherosclerosis was similar (52\% in men and 51.7\% in women). Conclusions\textemdash This study demonstrates that coronary atherosclerosis begins at a young age and that lesions are present in 1 of 6 teenagers. These findings suggest the need for intensive efforts at coronary disease prevention in young adults.},

  abstract = {In recent years, a number of studies have alluded to the importance of the intestinal microflora in controlling whole-body metabolic homeostasis and organ physiology. In particular, it has been suggested that the hepatic production of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) from gut microbiota-derived trimethylamine (TMA) may enhance cardiovascular risk via promoting atherosclerotic lesion development. The source of TMA production via the gut microbiota appears to originate from 2 principle sources, either phosphatidylcholine/choline and/or l-carnitine. Therefore, it has been postulated that consumption of these dietary sources, which are often found in large quantities in red meats, may be critical factors promoting cardiovascular risk. In contrast, a number of studies demonstrate beneficial properties for l-carnitine consumption against metabolic diseases including skeletal muscle insulin resistance and ischemic heart disease. Furthermore, fish are a significant source of TMAO, but dietary fish consumption and fish oil supplementation may exhibit positive effects on cardiovascular health. In this mini-review we will discuss the discrepancies regarding l-carnitine supplementation and its possible negative effects on cardiovascular risk through potential increases in TMAO production, as well as its positive effects on metabolic health via increasing glucose metabolism in the muscle and heart.},

  abstract = {Vitex agnus-castus L. (chaste tree; chasteberry) is a popular herbal treatment, predominantly used for a range of female reproductive conditions in Anglo-American and European practice. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the evidence for the efficacy and safety of Vitex extracts from randomised, controlled trials investigating women's health. Eight databases were searched using Latin and common names for Vitex and phytotherapeutic preparations of the herb as a sole agent, together with filters for randomised, controlled trials or clinical trials. Methodological quality was assessed according to the Cochrane risk of bias and Jadad scales, as well as the proposed elaboration of CONSORT for reporting trials on herbal interventions. Thirteen randomised, controlled trials were identified and twelve are included in this review, of which eight investigated premenstrual syndrome, two premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and two latent hyperprolactinaemia. For premenstrual syndrome, seven of eight trials found Vitex extracts to be superior to placebo (5 of 6 studies), pyridoxine (1), and magnesium oxide (1). In premenstrual dysphoric disorder, one study reported Vitex to be equivalent to fluoxetine, while in the other, fluoxetine outperformed Vitex. In latent hyperprolactinaemia, one trial reported it to be superior to placebo for reducing TRH-stimulated prolactin secretion, normalising a shortened luteal phase, increasing mid-luteal progesterone and 17{$\beta$}-oestradiol levels, while the other found Vitex comparable to bromocriptine for reducing serum prolactin levels and ameliorating cyclic mastalgia. Adverse events with Vitex were mild and generally infrequent. The methodological quality of the included studies varied, but was generally moderate-to-high. Limitations include small sample sizes in some studies, heterogeneity of conditions being treated, and a range of reference treatments. Despite some methodological limitations, the results from randomised, controlled trials to date suggest benefits for Vitex extracts in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome, premenstrual dysphoric disorder and latent hyperprolactinaemia. Further research is recommended, and greater transparency in reporting for future trials.},

The drug reduced serum total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and LDL-apoprotein (apo)B levels up to 34\%. Less-consistent decreases in intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol were also seen. None of the control patients and two of the IBP patients became normolipidemic (LDL {$<$}4 mmol/L). Marked transient reductions in serum free-methylated-cholesterol precursors, and more-constant decreases in the esterified and total fractions, suggested that cholesterol synthesis was reduced shortly after the start of treatment. The decreases in total lathosterol and methylsterols were more extensive in the IBP group than in the control group. Serum plant sterol levels were slightly increased, with inconsistent elevations of cholestanol. Reduced fecal elimination of cholesterol and its precursors suggests that decreased cholesterol synthesis was mainly due to lowered bile acid production, particularly in the IBP group with markedly enhanced basal bile acid and cholesterol synthesis. The serum and fecal levels of cholesterol precursors, lathosterol in particular, were related to each other and were proportionate to the serum level and fecal elimination of cholesterol. Absorption efficiency of cholesterol tended to be decreased, and mass calculations showed that biliary secretion and total absorption of cholesterol were clearly reduced in both groups by pravastatin. The findings suggest that the pravastatin-induced reduction of cholesterol synthesis and absorption are mainly balanced by lowered biliary and fecal output of cholesterol and bile acids. Determination of total lathosterol by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) from nonsaponifiable serum lipids seems suitable for monitoring cholesterol metabolism during pravastatin treatment.},

Appropriate treatment considerations in such cases are unclear. Objectives To assess discordance between apoB determined by immunoassay and LDL-PNMR in routine clinical practice, and to characterize biomarker profiles and other clinical characteristics of patients identified as discordant. Methods Two retrospective cohorts were evaluated. First, 412,013 patients with laboratory testing performed by Health Diagnostic Laboratory, Inc., as part of routine care; and second, 1411 consecutive patients presenting for risk assessment/reduction at 6 US outpatient clinics. Discordance was quantified as a percentile difference (LDL-PNMR percentile - apoB percentile) and attainment of percentile cutpoints (LDL-PNMR~{$\geq~$}1073~nmol/L or apoB~{$\geq~$}69~mg/dL). A wide range of cardiovascular risk factors were compared. Results ApoB and LDL-PNMR values were highly correlated (R2~=~0.79), although substantial discordance was observed. Similar numbers of patients were identified as at-risk by LDL-PNMR when apoB levels were {$<$} 69~mg/dL (5\%-6\%) and by apoB values when LDL-PNMR was {$<~$}1073~nmol/L (6\%-7\%). Discordance (LDL-PNMR~{$>~$}apoB) was associated with insulin resistance, smaller LDL particle size, increased systemic inflammation, and low circulating levels of ``traditional'' lipids, whereas discordance (apoB~{$>~$}LDL-PNMR) was associated with larger LDL particle size, and elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2). Conclusion Discordance between apoB and LDL-PNMR in routine clinical practice is more widespread than currently recognized and may be associated with insulin resistance.},

Methods and results: We conducted a prospective post hoc analysis of individuals enrolled at the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults, which is a multi-centre bi-racial cohort with 30\,years of follow-up. Cumulative systolic and diastolic BP levels were defined by summing the product of average millimetres of mercury and the years between each two consecutive clinic visits over 30\,years of follow-up. Multivariable linear regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between cumulative systolic and diastolic BP with 3DE LA structure and function, adjusting for demographics and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. A total of 1033 participants were included, mean age was 55.4\,{$\pm$}\,3.5\,years, 55.2\% women, 43.9\% blacks. Cumulative systolic BP had stronger correlations than cumulative diastolic BP. Higher cumulative systolic BP was independently associated with higher 3D LA volumes: maximum ({$\beta$}\,=\,1.74, P\,=\,0.004), pre-atrial contraction ({$\beta$}\,=\,1.87, P\,{$<$}\,0.001), minimum ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.76, P\,=\,0.04), total emptying ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.98, P\,=\,0.006), active emptying ({$\beta$}\,=\,1.12, P\,{$<$}\,0.001), and lower magnitude 3D LA early diastolic strain rate ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.05, P\,=\,0.02). Higher cumulative diastolic BP was independently associated with higher 3D LA active emptying volume ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.66, P\,=\,0.002), lower magnitude 3D LA early diastolic strain rate ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.05, P\,=\,0.004), and higher magnitude 3D LA late diastolic strain rate ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.04, P\,=\,0.05).

Interventions He came to the emergency department complaining of a painful swollen ecchymotic leg and dyspnea. Prescriptions for narcotics did not relieve his symptoms. When a detailed dietary history was obtained, we added scurvy to the differential diagnosis. An extensive evaluation excluded trauma, coagulopathies, neoplasia, and vasculitides. Main Result The combination of a classic skin biopsy and a low vitamin C level confirmed the diagnosis. Conclusion This presentation illustrates the necessity of including scurvy in the differential diagnosis of ecchymoses and demonstrates specific populations at risk: single adults and the elderly with deficient diets.},

We aimed to determine whether genetic variants at the locus encoding phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP), a protein involved in HDL remodeling, underlie altered PLTP activity, HDL particle concentration and size, and cardiovascular disease risk. Methods and Results\textemdash We assessed associations between 6 PLTP tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms and PLTP activity in 2 studies (combined nϭ384) and identified 2 variants that show reproducible associations with altered plasma PLTP activity. A gene score based on these variants is associated with lower hepatic PLTP transcription (Pϭ3.2ϫ10Ϫ18) in a third study (nϭ957) and with an increased number of HDL particles of smaller size (Pϭ3.4ϫ10Ϫ17) in a fourth study (nϭ3375). In a combination of 5 cardiovascular disease case-control studies (nϭ4658 cases and 11 459 controls), a higher gene score was associated with a lower cardiovascular disease risk (per-allele odds ratio, 0.94; 95\% confidence interval, 0.90 to 0.98; Pϭ1.2ϫ10Ϫ3; odds ratio for highest versus lowest gene score, 0.69; 95\% confidence interval, 0.55 to 0.86; Pϭ1.0ϫ10Ϫ3). Conclusions\textemdash A gene score based on 2 PLTP single nucleotide polymorphisms is associated with lower PLTP transcription and activity, an increased number of HDL particles, smaller HDL size, and decreased risk of cardiovascular disease. These findings indicate that PLTP is a proatherogenic entity and suggest that modulation of specific elements of HDL metabolism may offer cardiovascular benefit. (Circulation. 2010;122:470-477.)},

  abstract = {Purpose We have developed a statistical prediction model for prostate cancer based on four kallikrein markers in blood: total, free, and intact prostate specific antigen (PSA) and kallikrein-related peptidase 2 (hK2). Although this model accurately predicts the result of biopsy in unscreened men, its properties for men with a history of PSA screening have not been fully characterized. Experimental Design 1501 previously screened men with elevated PSA underwent initial biopsy during rounds 2 and 3 of the European Randomized Study of Prostate Cancer Screening, Rotterdam, with 388 cancers diagnosed. Biomarker levels were measured in serum samples taken before biopsy. The prediction model developed on the unscreened cohort was then applied and predictions compared to biopsy outcome. Results The previously developed four-kallikrein prediction model had much higher predictive accuracy than PSA and age alone (area-under-the-curve of 0.711 vs. 0.585 and 0.713 vs. 0.557 with and without digital rectal exam, respectively; both p{$<$}0.001). Similar statistically significant enhancements were seen for high-grade cancer. Applying the model with a cut-off of 20\% cancer risk as the criterion for biopsy would reduce the biopsy rate by 362 for every 1000 men with elevated PSA. Although diagnosis would be delayed for 47 cancers, these would be predominately low stage and low grade (83\% Gleason 6 T1c).

Such change is measured by PSA velocity or PSA doubling time, described in general as ``PSA kinetics''. However, it turns out that calculation of PSA velocity and doubling time is far from straightforward. More than 20 different methods have been proposed, and many of these give quite divergent results. There is clear evidence that PSA kinetics are critical for understanding prognosis in advanced or relapsed prostate cancer. However, PSA kinetics have no value for men with an untreated prostate: neither PSA velocity nor doubling time have any role in diagnosing prostate cancer or providing a prognosis for men before treatment.},

  abstract = {Concerns have been raised regarding the availability of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) during an influenza pandemic. One possible strategy to mitigate a respirator shortage is to reuse FFRs following a biological decontamination process to render infectious material on the FFR inactive. However, little data exist on the effects of decontamination methods on respirator integrity and performance. This study evaluated five decontamination methods [ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), ethylene oxide, vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), microwave oven irradiation, and bleach] using nine models of NIOSH-certified respirators (three models each of N95 FFRs, surgical N95 respirators, and P100 FFRs) to determine which methods should be considered for future research studies. Following treatment by each decontamination method, the FFRs were evaluated for changes in physical appearance, odor, and laboratory performance (filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance). Additional experiments (dry heat laboratory oven exposures, off-gassing, and FFR hydrophobicity) were subsequently conducted to better understand material properties and possible health risks to the respirator user following decontamination. However, this study did not assess the efficiency of the decontamination methods to inactivate viable microorganisms. Microwave oven irradiation melted samples from two FFR models. The remainder of the FFR samples that had been decontaminated had expected levels of filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance. The scent of bleach remained noticeable following overnight drying and low levels of chlorine gas were found to off-gas from bleach-decontaminated FFRs when rehydrated with deionized water. UVGI, ethylene oxide (EtO), and VHP were found to be the most promising decontamination methods; however, concerns remain about the throughput capabilities for EtO and VHP. Further research is needed before any specific decontamination methods can be recommended.},

This was characterized by hyperexcitability, hyperemia of the ears, calcium deposition in the kidney tubules, low serum magnesium levels, and decreased oxidative phosphorylation of heart mitochondria. All these lesions were prevented by raising the dietary magnesium level four to eight times. Feeding the atherogenic diet produced the deposition of lipide in the aorta and in the heart valves. The extent of this intimal sudanophilia was reduced by large amounts of dietary magnesium although serum cholesterol values did not fall and usually rose. This represents perhaps the first clear cut disassociation between serum cholesterol values and the extent of intimal sudanophilia. Raising the level of dietary protein from 10 to 20 per cent decreased the serum cholesterol levels and the extent of the kidney lesions. Thyroxine administration lowered the serum cholesterol values, abolished the kidney lesions and reduced the intimal sudanophilia. These effects occurred even though the serum magnesium levels remained low.},

Sports nutrition recommendations for endurance exercise however remains a complex issue with often opposing views and advice by various health care professionals. Methods: A PubMed/Medline search on the topics of endurance, athletes, nutrition, and performance was undertaken and a review performed summarizing the current evidence concerning macronutrients, hydration, and supplements as it pertains to endurance athletes. Results: Carbohydrate and hydration recommendations have not drastically changed in years, while protein and fat intake have been traditionally underemphasized in endurance athletes. Several supplements are commercially available to athletes, of which, few may be of benefit for endurance activities, including nitrates, antioxidants, caffeine, and probiotics, and are reviewed here. The topic of ``train low,'' training in a low carbohydrate state is also discussed, and the post-exercise nutritional ``recovery window'' remains an important point to emphasize to endurance competitors. Conclusions: This review summarizes the key recommendations for macronutrients, hydration, and supplements for endurance athletes, and helps clinicians treating endurance athletes clear up misconceptions in sports nutrition research when counseling the endurance athlete.},

Currently, number of unnecessary prostate biopsies are being performed in the United States. This is due to the absence of appropriate biopsy decision-making protocol. Aim To develop and validate a 4K score/multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI)-based nomogram to predict prostate cancer (PCa), clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa), and unfavorable prostate cancer (uPCa). Methods and Results Retrospective, single-center study evaluating a cohort of 574 men with 4K score test {$>$}7\% or suspicious digital rectal examination (DRE) or Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scores 3, 4, or 5 on mpMRI that underwent systematic and/or mpMRI/ultrasound fusion\textendash targeted prostate biopsy between 2016 and 2020. External cohort included 622 men. csPCa and uPCa were defined as Gleason score {$\geq$}3\,+\,4 and {$\geq$}4\,+\,3 on biopsy, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to build nomogram for predicting PCa, csPCa, and uPCa. Validation was performed by plotting the area under the curve (AUC) and comparing nomogram-predicted probabilities with actual rates of PCa, csPCa, and uPCa probabilities in the external cohort., 4K score, a PI-RADS {$\geq$}4, prostate volume and prior negative biopsy were significant predictors of PCa, csPCa, and uPCa. AUCs were 0.84, 0.88, and 0.86 for the prediction of PCa, csPCa, and uPCa, respectively. The predicted and actual rates of PCa, csPCa, and uPCa showed agreement across all percentage probability ranges in the validation cohort. Using the prediction model at threshold of 30, 30\% of overall biopsies, 41\% of benign biopsies, and 19\% of diagnosed indolent PCa could be avoided, while missing 9\% of csPCa. Conclusion This novel nomogram would reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies and decrease detection of clinically insignificant PCa.},

  abstract = {Background: Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly used to diagnose prostate cancer (PCa). It is not yet established whether all men with negative MRI (Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System version 2 score {$<$}3) should undergo prostate biopsy or not. Objective: To develop and validate a prediction model that uses clinical parameters to reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies by predicting PCa and clinically significant PCa (csPCa) for men with negative MRI findings who are at risk of harboring PCa. Design setting and participants: This was a retrospective analysis of 200 men with negative MRI at risk of PCa who underwent prostate biopsy (2014-2020) with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) {$>$}4\,ng/ml, 4Kscore of {$>$}7\%, PSA density {$\geq$}0.15\,ng/ml/cm3, and/or suspicious digital rectal examination. The validation cohort included 182 men from another centre (University of Miami) with negative MRI who underwent systematic prostate biopsy with the same criteria. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: csPCa was defined as Gleason grade group {$\geq$}2 on biopsy. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed using coefficients of logit function for predicting PCa and csPCa. Nomogram validation was performed by calculating the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and comparing nomogram-predicted probabilities with actual rates of PCa and csPCa. Results and limitations: Of 200 men in the development cohort, 18\% showed PCa and 8\% showed csPCa on biopsy. Of 182 men in the validation cohort, 21\% showed PCa and 6\% showed csPCa on biopsy. PSA density, 4Kscore, and family history of PCa were significant predictors for PCa and csPCa. The AUC was 0.80 and 0.87 for prediction of PCa and csPCa, respectively. There was agreement between predicted and actual rates of PCa in the validation cohort. Using the prediction model at threshold of 40, 47\% of benign biopsies and 15\% of indolent PCa cases diagnosed could be avoided, while missing 10\% of csPCa cases. The small sample size and number of events are limitations of the study. Conclusions: Our prediction model can reduce the number of prostate biopsies among men with negative MRI without compromising the detection of csPCa. Patient summary: We developed a tool for selection of men with negative MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) findings for prostate cancer who should undergo prostate biopsy. This risk prediction tool safely reduces the number of men who need to undergo the procedure.},

  abstract = {Progressive resistance exercise training (PRT) is the most effective known intervention for combating aging skeletal muscle atrophy. However, the hypertrophic response to PRT is variable, and this may be due to muscle inflammation susceptibility. Metformin reduces inflammation, so we hypothesized that metformin would augment the muscle response to PRT in healthy women and men aged 65 and older. In a randomized, double-blind trial, participants received 1,700 mg/day metformin (N = 46) or placebo (N = 48) throughout the study, and all subjects performed 14 weeks of supervised PRT. Although responses to PRT varied, placebo gained more lean body mass (p = .003) and thigh muscle mass (p {$<$} .001) than metformin. CT scan showed that increases in thigh muscle area (p = .005) and density (p = .020) were greater in placebo versus metformin. There was a trend for blunted strength gains in metformin that did not reach statistical significance. Analyses of vastus lateralis muscle biopsies showed that metformin did not affect fiber hypertrophy, or increases in satellite cell or macrophage abundance with PRT. However, placebo had decreased type I fiber percentage while metformin did not (p = .007). Metformin led to an increase in AMPK signaling, and a trend for blunted increases in mTORC1 signaling in response to PRT. These results underscore the benefits of PRT in older adults, but metformin negatively impacts the hypertrophic response to resistance training in healthy older individuals.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reliable, large-scale, population-based data on blood pressure for Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations are limited. This present study aims to describe the blood pressure levels and to explore the clinical risk factors for hypertension among Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. DESIGN: A cross-sectional population survey was conducted in isolated communities in northern and central Australia. METHODS: Australian Aboriginal people (n = 1088) and Torres Strait Islanders (n = 606) aged 15 years and over were examined between 1993 and 1997. Blood pressure, body mass index, plasma glucose and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio were measured. The association of systolic, diastolic and pulse blood pressure to age was determined and independent associations of hypertension with other clinical variables were tested using logistic regression. Comparisons with results from other Australian data (including AusDiab) were made. RESULTS: Systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure increased in a linear manner with age but mean diastolic blood pressure leveled off at around 50 years and decreased thereafter, suggestive of arterial stiffening. The age-standardized prevalence of hypertension (blood pressure {$>$} or = 140/90 mmHg or medication) for subjects aged 25-54 years was 27\%, compared with 9\% in non-Indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory and Queensland (AusDiab Survey). Older age, male sex, higher body mass index, albumin-creatinine ratio and diabetes were independently associated with hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated blood pressure is a public health concern for indigenous people, which again highlights health differentials in Australia. Early detection and management of high blood pressure should be assigned a high priority in Indigenous communities.},

However, its mechanism of action has only been partially determined. Compounds, fractions, and extracts isolated from VAC were used in this study to thoroughly investigate possible opioidergic activity. First, an extract of VAC was found to bind and activate {$\mu$}- and {$\delta$}-, but not {$\kappa$}- opioid receptor subtypes (MOR, DOR, and KOR respectively). The extract was then resuspended in 10\% methanol and partitioned sequentially with petroleum ether, CHCl3, and EtOAc to form four fractions including a water fraction. The highest affinity for MOR was concentrated in the CHCl3 fraction, whereas the highest affinity for DOR was found in the CHCl3 and EtOAc fractions. However, the petroleum ether fraction had the highest agonist activity at MOR and DOR. Several flavonoids from VAC were found to bind to both MOR and DOR in a dose-dependent manner; however only casticin, a marker compound for genus Vitex, was found to have agonist activity selective for DOR at high concentrations. These results suggest VAC may exert its therapeutic effects through the activation of MOR, DOR, but not KOR.},

Here we show that the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) scavenger receptor B type 1 (SR-B1) facilitates ACE2-dependent entry of SARS-CoV-2. We find that the S1 subunit of SARS-2-S binds to cholesterol and possibly to HDL components to enhance viral uptake in vitro. SR-B1 expression facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry into ACE2-expressing cells by augmenting virus attachment. Blockade of the cholesterol-binding site on SARS-2-S1 with a monoclonal antibody, or treatment of cultured cells with pharmacological SR-B1 antagonists, inhibits HDL-enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infection. We further show that SR-B1 is coexpressed with ACE2 in human pulmonary tissue and in several extrapulmonary tissues. Our findings reveal that SR-B1 acts as a host factor that promotes SARS-CoV-2 entry and may help explain viral tropism, identify a possible molecular connection between COVID-19 and lipoprotein metabolism, and highlight SR-B1 as a potential therapeutic target to interfere with SARS-CoV-2 infection.},

METHODS: We identified all men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the National Cancer Data Base (2004-2013) at 1089 different health-care facilities in the United States. Joinpoint regressions were used to model annual percentage changes (APCs) in the incidence of prostate cancer based on stage relative to that of 2004. RESULTS: The annual incidence of metastatic prostate cancer increased from 2007 to 2013 (Joinpoint regression: APC: 7.1\%, P{$<$}0.05) and in 2013 was 72\% more than that of 2004. The incidence of low-risk prostate cancer decreased from years 2007 to 2013 (APC: -9.3\%, P{$<$}0.05) to 37\% less than that of 2004. The greatest increase in metastatic prostate cancer was seen in men aged 55-69 years (92\% increase from 2004 to 2013). CONCLUSIONS: Beginning in 2007, the incidence of metastatic prostate cancer has increased especially among men in the age group thought most likely to benefit from definitive treatment for prostate cancer.

Their comments are inserted in grey boxes and are intended to give tips and tricks borne of experience and to provide context to the literature, \&quot;as if\&quot; they are standing over our shoulder and advising during a resuscitation.Additionally, there are three chapters where we address the medical-legal aspects of care. Enter Greg Henry MD, past president of The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) and one of the most experienced physician medical-legal experts in the country. He opines on the approach that both the defense and plaintiff would likely pursue and, by extension, how we can make patients safer through our evaluation and documentation before there is an adverse outcome. Whereas, these chapters contain the actual documentation from the ED chart, a very few chapters have slight modifications to the final aspects of the return visit at decision point 3, to allow for exploration of different critical care scenarios. There is still plenty of commentary on the documentation, missed red-flags, and what could have been done to improve care at the initial visit. Our goal is to make each chapter challenging, dynamic, and realistic\ldots{} to move us from ``standard of care'' to ``excellence in care.''Book Review:\&quot;It\&\#39;s back, it\&\#39;s Bouncebacks!

  abstract = {Background Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHB) is an autosomal codominant disorder characterized by abnormally low plasma levels of apoB and LDL cholesterol. Heterozygotes for FHB almost always have plasma LDL cholesterol levels {$<$}70 mg/dL and are asymptomatic. Because the low cholesterol levels may protect FHB heterozygotes from coronary heart disease, the mechanisms for FHB are of considerable interest. Methods and Results The plasma lipoproteins of 29 subjects with LDL cholesterol levels {$<$}70 mg/dL were examined by SDS-PAGE. One subject who had virtually undetectable levels of LDL cholesterol had a truncated apoB, apoB-44.4, in his lipoproteins; a second subject with an LDL cholesterol level of 44 mg/dL had apoB-55 in his lipoproteins. The apoB-44.4 (2014 amino acids in length) resulted from a frameshift caused by an 11-bp insertion in exon 26 of the apoB gene; the apoB-55 (2494 amino acids) was caused by a nonsense mutation in exon 26 of the apoB gene. The apoB-55 mutation occurred at a CpG dinucleotide pair, a mutational hot spot, and was identical to a mutation described previously in a subject with hypobetalipoproteinemia. Our subject with apoB-55, however, had a different haplotype than the subject described previously, suggesting that the two apoB-55 mutations may have arisen independently. Of note, the apoB-55 proband's father, who had very low cholesterol levels and who probably carried the apoB-55 mutation, had significant coronary and aortic atherosclerosis at autopsy. Conclusions In a study of adults with low LDL cholesterol levels, we discovered two subjects with truncated apoB proteins and identified the responsible mutations. ApoB gene mutations causing truncated apoB are not particularly rare in subjects with low cholesterol levels. The role of these mutations in preventing atherosclerosis deserves further study.},

  abstract = {Purpose of Review Several mutations in the apoB, PCSK9 and MTP genes result in low or absent levels of apoB and LDL-C in plasma which cause familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL) and abetalipoproteinemia (ABL). Mutations in the ANGPTL3 gene cause familial combined hypolipidemia. Clinical manifestations range from none to severe, debilitating and life-threatening disorders. This review summarizes recent genetic, metabolic and clinical findings and presents an update on management strategies. Recent findings Cases of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma have now been identified in heterozygous FHBL probably due to decreased triglyceride transport capacity from the liver. ANGPTL3 mutations cause low levels of LDL-C and low HDL-C in compound heterozygotes and homozygous subjects, decrease reverse cholesterol transport and lower glucose levels. The effect on atherosclerosis is unknown; however, severe fatty liver has been identified. Loss of function mutations in PCSK-9 cause FHBL which appears to lower risk for CAD and have no adverse sequelae. Phase III clinical trials are now underway examining the effect of PCSK-9 inhibitors on cardiovascular events in combination with statin drugs. Summary Mutations causing low LDL-C and apoB have provided insight into lipid metabolism, disease associations and the basis for drug development to lower LDL-C in disorders causing high levels of cholesterol. Early diagnosis and treatment is necessary to prevent adverse sequelae from FHBL and ABL.},

  abstract = {The trend toward personalized approaches to health and medicine has resulted in a need to collect high-dimensional datasets on individuals from a wide variety of populations, in order to generate customized intervention strategies. However, it is not always clear whether insights derived from studies in patient populations or in controlled trial settings are transferable to individuals in the general population. To address this issue, a longitudinal analysis was conducted on blood biomarker data from 1032 generally healthy individuals who used an automated, web-based personalized nutrition and lifestyle platform. The study had two main aims: to analyze correlations between biomarkers for biological insights, and to characterize the effectiveness of the platform in improving biomarker levels. First, a biomarker correlation network was constructed to generate biological hypotheses that are relevant to researchers and, potentially, to users of personalized wellness tools. The correlation network revealed expected patterns, such as the established relationships between blood lipid levels, as well as novel insights, such as a connection between neutrophil and triglyceride concentrations that has been suggested as a relevant indicator of cardiovascular risk. Next, biomarker changes during platform use were assessed, showing a trend toward normalcy for most biomarkers in those participants whose values were out of the clinically normal range at baseline. Finally, associations were found between the selection of specific interventions and corresponding biomarker changes, suggesting directions for future study.},

Participants receiving hypertension medication were excluded. Coronary artery calcium was classified as absent or present and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were calculated for incident ASCVD. The study was conducted from March 27, 2018, to February 12, 2020.Systolic blood pressure.Presence or absence of coronary artery calcium and incident ASCVD events.Of the 1457 participants, 894 were women (61.4\%); mean (SD) age was 58.1 (9.8) years and mean (SD) follow-up was 14.5 (3.9) years. There was an increase in traditional ASCVD risk factors, coronary artery calcium, and incident ASCVD events with increasing SBP levels. The aHR for ASCVD was 1.53 (95\% CI, 1.17-1.99) for every 10-mm Hg increase in SBP levels. Compared with persons with SBP levels 90 to 99 mm Hg, the aHR for ASCVD risk was 3.00 (95\% CI, 1.01-8.88) for SBP levels 100 to 109 mm Hg, 3.10 (95\% CI, 1.03-9.28) for SBP levels 110 to 119 mm Hg, and 4.58 (95\% CI, 1.47-14.27) for SBP levels 120 to 129 mm Hg.Beginning at an SBP level as low as 90 mm Hg, there appears to be a stepwise increase in the presence of coronary artery calcium and the risk of incident ASCVD with increasing SBP levels. These results highlight the importance of primordial prevention for SBP level increase and other traditional ASCVD risk factors, which generally seem to have similar trajectories of graded increase in risk within values traditionally considered to be normal.},

It has additional HMG-CoA reductase enzyme-binding interactions that cause tighter binding, has substantial active transport into hepatocytes, and has the lowest (LDL) for sterol synthesis in hepatocytes. Rosuvastatin 10 mg and 80 mg dosages have superior low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol-lowering efficacy as compared to atorvastatin 10 mg and 80 mg. Rosuvastatin 10 mg has also been shown to have superior LDL reductions to 20 mg of both simvastatin and pravastatin. This agent can raise high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 8\% to 12\% and lower triglycerides by 10\% to 35\%. Rosuvastatin is a hydrophilic agent with poor penetration in extrahepatic tissue such as human umbilical vein endothelial cells and fibroblasts. It also has a low potential for cytochrome P450 drug interactions and can be dosed in the morning or night. In conclusion, rosuvastatin is an agent with molecular alterations that provide it with unique pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic effects. As such, it is a novel and unique HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor for the treatment of hyperlipidemia.},

The GRADE methodology was used; the strength of a recommendation is indicated by a number ``1'' (strong recommendation, we recommend) or ``2'' (weak recommendation, we suggest).Multiple e-mail communications and conference calls determined consensus. Committees of the Endocrine Society, ASRM, ACOG, ESE, and IMS reviewed and commented on the drafts of the guidelines.We continue to recommend against making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency syndrome in healthy women because there is a lack of a well-defined syndrome, and data correlating androgen levels with specific signs or symptoms are unavailable.We recommend against the general use of T for the following indications: infertility; sexual dysfunction other than hypoactive sexual desire disorder; cognitive, cardiovascular, metabolic, or bone health; or general well-being.We recommend against the routine use of dehydroepiandrosterone due to limited data concerning its effectiveness and safety in normal women or those with adrenal insufficiency.We recommend against the routine prescription of T or dehydroepiandrosterone for the treatment of women with low androgen levels due to hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency, surgical menopause, pharmacological glucocorticoid administration, or other conditions associated with low androgen levels because there are limited data supporting improvement in signs and symptoms with therapy and no long-term studies of risk.Evidence supports the short-term efficacy and safety of high physiological doses of T treatment of postmenopausal women with sexual dysfunction due to hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Importantly, endogenous T levels did not predict response to therapy. At present, physiological T preparations for use in women are not available in many countries including the United States, and long-term safety data are lacking. We recommend that any woman receiving T therapy be monitored for signs and symptoms of androgen excess.We outline areas for future research. Ongoing improvement in androgen assays will allow a redefinition of normal ranges across the lifespan; this may help to clarify the impact of varying concentrations of plasma androgens on the biology, physiology, and psychology in women and lead to indications for therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Serotonin regulates gastrointestinal function, and mast cells are a potential nonneuronal source of serotonin in the esophagus. Tight junction (TJ) proteins in the esophageal epithelium contribute to the barrier function, and the serotonin signaling pathway may contribute to epithelial leakage in gastroesophageal reflux disease. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of serotonin on barrier function, TJ proteins, and related signaling pathways. METHODS: Normal primary human esophageal epithelial cells were cultured with use of an air-liquid interface system. Serotonin was added to the basolateral compartment, and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured. The expression of TJ proteins and serotonin receptor 7 (5-HT7) was assessed by Western blotting. The involvement of 5-HT7 was assessed with use of an antagonist and an agonist. The underlying cellular signaling pathways were examined with use of specific blockers. RESULTS: Serotonin decreased TEER and reduced the expression of TJ proteins ZO-1, occludin, and claudin~1, but not claudin~4. A 5-HT7 antagonist blocked the serotonin-induced decrease in TEER, and a 5-HT7 agonist decreased TEER. Inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) reduced the serotonin-induced decrease in TEER. Inhibition of p38 MAPK blocked the decrease of ZO-1 levels, whereas extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibition blocked the decrease in occludin levels. Cell signaling pathway inhibitors had no effect on serotonin-induced alterations in claudin~1 and claudin~4 levels. Serotonin induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK, and a 5-HT7 antagonist partially blocked serotonin-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK but not that of ERK. CONCLUSIONS: Serotonin disrupted esophageal squamous epithelial barrier function by modulating the levels of TJ proteins. Serotonin signaling pathways may mediate the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease.},

A comparison cohort of 303640 persons without appendectomy was selected randomly, frequency matched by age, sex, comorbidity and entry year was also selected. We monitored subsequent colorectal cancer development in both cohorts. Results The overall colorectal cancer incidence was 14\% higher in the appendectomy patients than in the comparison cohort (p {$<$}0.05): the highest incidence was observed for rectal cancer, and the lowest incidence was observed for cancer of the cecum-ascending colon for both cohorts. Men were at higher risk than women. Subjects {$\geq$} 60 years had an HR of 12.8 compared to those {$<$}60 years. The incidence of colorectal cancer was much higher in 1.5-3.5 years post appendectomy follow-up than for the comparisons (HR of 2.13).

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Background The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus threatens global public health. Currently, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) versus this virus are expected to correlate with recovery and protection of this disease. However, the characteristics of these antibodies have not been well studied in association with the clinical manifestations in patients. Methods Plasma collected from 175 COVID-19 recovered patients with mild symptoms were screened using a safe and sensitive pseudotyped-lentiviral-vector-based neutralization assay. Spike-binding antibody in plasma were determined by ELISA using RBD, S1, and S2 proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The levels and the time course of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs and the spike-binding antibodies were monitored at the same time. Findings SARS-CoV-2 NAbs were unable to cross-reactive with SARS-CoV virus. SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs were detected in patients from day 10-15 after the onset of the disease and remained thereafter. The titers of NAb among these patients correlated with the spike-binding antibodies targeting S1, RBD, and S2 regions. The titers of NAbs were variable in different patients. Elderly and middle-age patients had significantly higher plasma NAb titers (P\&lt;0.0001) and spike-binding antibodies (P=0.0003) than young patients. Notably, among these patients, there were ten patients whose NAb titers were under the detectable level of our assay (ID50: \&lt; 40); while in contrast, two patients, showed very high titers of NAb, with ID50 :15989 and 21567 respectively. The NAb titers were positive correlated with plasma CRP levels but negative correlated with the lymphocyte counts of patients at the time of admission, indicating an association between humoral response and cellular immune response. Interpretation The variations of SARS-CoV-2 specific NAbs in recovered COVID-19 patients may raise the concern about the role of NAbs on disease progression. The correlation of NAb titers with age, lymphocyte counts, and blood CRP levels suggested that the interplay between virus and host immune response in coronavirus infections should be further explored for the development of effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 virus. Furthermore, titration of NAb is helpful prior to the use of convalescent plasma for prevention or treatment.

Therefore, the formation of a large thrombus is a critical step in the development of atherothrombosis. However, little is known about the mechanisms involved in thrombus growth processes after plaque disruption. Studies in vivo have demonstrated that the tissue factor (TF) derived from the vascular wall contributes to the formation of thrombin-dependent platelet\textendash fibrin thrombus on atherosclerotic arteries but not on normal arteries, and that altered blood flow in disrupted atherosclerotic arteries promotes platelet recruitment mediated by von Willebrand factor (VWF) on the thrombus surface and augmented blood coagulation resulting in thrombus growth. The thrombogenic potential of plaques is a fundamental factor in atherothrombosis. We recently found that the arterial glucose uptake reflects vascular thrombogenicity, which might be partly explained by metabolic adaptation and enhanced procoagulant activity in a hypoxic microenvironment. Hypoxic responses might link atherometabolism to vascular thrombogenicity.},

Gastroesophageal reflux impairs the mucosal barrier in the distal esophagus, allowing chronic exposure of the squamous epithelium to the diverse microbial ecosystem or microbiome and inducing chronic inflammation. The esophageal microbiome is altered in both esophagitis and Barrett esophagus, characterized by a significant decrease in gram-positive bacteria and an increase in gram-negative bacteria in esophagitis and Barrett esophagus. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a major structure of the outer membrane in gram-negative bacteria, can upregulate gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines via activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 and NF-{$\kappa$}B pathway. The potential impact of LPS on reflux esophagitis may be through relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter via inducible nitric oxide synthase and by delaying gastric emptying via cyclooxygenase-2. Chronic inflammation may play a critical role in the progression from benign to malignant esophageal disease. Therefore, analysis of the pathways leading to chronic inflammation in the esophagus may help to identify biomarkers in patients with Barrett esophagus for neoplastic progression and provide insight into molecular events suitable for therapeutic intervention in prevention of esophageal adenocarcinoma development in patients with reflux esophagitis and Barrett esophagus.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The measurement that is termed 'LDL-cholesterol' (LDL-C) includes the cholesterol content of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)-C], which can contribute approximately 30-45\% to measured LDL-C levels as a percentage of its mass. We review the implications of achieved very low LDL-C levels in patients treated with potent LDL-C-lowering agents in the context of varying Lp(a) levels. RECENT FINDINGS: Combination therapy with statins, ezetimibe, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors can lower LDL-C to unprecedentedly low levels. Recent PCSK9 trials have shown that routine achievement of mean LDL-C less than 50{$\mkern1mu$}mg/dl is feasible, along with the modest reductions in Lp(a). Many patients will achieve LDL-C less than 25{$\mkern1mu$}mg/dl with concomitantly elevated Lp(a) levels that contribute substantially to the measured 'LDL-C'. Therefore, it is possible that some of these patients may have little to no circulating LDL-C. SUMMARY: As the new era of ultralow LDL-C levels ensues, it is imperative to understand the contribution of Lp(a)-C to measured LDL-C and the consequences of achieving ultralow or potentially absent LDL-C in the setting of elevated Lp(a) levels and possibly free apo(a). We review this concept and suggest avenues of research, including analyses of existing datasets in current clinical trials and new research studies, to understand its pathophysiological and clinical significance.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is generally measured as total mass of the entire particle or as apolipoprotein(a) particle number. OBJECTIVE: The cholesterol content of Lp(a) [Lp(a)-C)] can be estimated by the vertical auto profile (VAP) method. We assessed whether this is an accurate surrogate measurement of Lp(a) mass. METHODS: VAP-Lp(a)-C and VAP-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) estimated by the VAP technique, Lp(a) mass, oxidized phospholipids on apolipoprotein B-100 (OxPL-apoB) that primarily reflect OxPL on Lp(a), and HDL-C measured by enzymatic methods were measured in 552 hypercholesterolemic patients at baseline and 24~weeks after~therapy with niacin monotherapy (N~=~118), ezetimibe/simvastatin monotherapy (n~=~155), or ezetimibe/simvastatin (10/20~mg)~+~niacin (to 2 g) (N~=~279) in a randomized, double-blind trial. RESULTS: VAP-Lp(a)-C correlated only modestly with Lp(a) mass at baseline (r~=~0.56, P~{$<~$}.001) and 24~weeks (r~=~0.56, P~{$<~$}.001), explaining only 31\% of the association. VAP-Lp(a)-C correlated with HDL-C at baseline (r~=~0.34, P~{$<~$}.001) and 24~weeks (r~=~0.30, P~{$<~$}.001) and with VAP-HDL-C at baseline (r~=~39, P~{$<~$}.001) and 24~weeks (r~=~0.33, P~{$<~$}.001). In contrast, Lp(a) mass did not correlate with HDL-C at baseline (r~=~0.06, P~=~.12) and 24~weeks (r~=~-0.01 P~=~.91). Lp(a) mass correlated strongly with oxidized phospholipids on apolipoprotein B-100 at baseline (r~=~0.81, P~{$<~$}.001) and 24~weeks (r~=~0.79, P~{$<~$}.001). VAP-Lp(a)-C levels increased linearly with HDL-C and VAP-HDL-C quartiles (P~{$<~$}.001 for both) but Lp(a) mass did not. Quantitating the percent of cholesterol present on Lp(a) by dividing VAP-Lp(a)-C by Lp(a) mass revealed that 25\% of patients had a percentage {$>$}100, which is not possible. CONCLUSIONS: VAP-Lp(a)-C is a poor estimate for Lp(a) mass and likely reflects the content of HDL-C in the overlapping density spectrum of Lp(a) and HDL. These data suggest that patients with prior VAP-Lp(a)-C measurements may have misclassification of Lp(a)-related risk.},

We conducted a MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar search. After a careful screening process of all authors, 32 of these articles were considered as appropriate, and reviewed. Our evaluations showed that CC has genotoxic, cytotoxic, embryotoxic and teratogenic properties. There is no association between the use of CC and risk of ovarian, breast, uterine, cervix, endometrium, lung, colorectal cancer, and lymphoma. However, risk increased especially after 6 cycles of use and especially in nulligravid women. The use of CC should be restricted to 6 cycles. Moreover, malignant melanoma and thyroid cancer risk was found to be higher among CC treated women in almost all studies. Further works should be conducted especially in animal models to assess its risk features.},

Although it is known that EE and CIT vary seasonally, their relationship with BAT has not been investigated. In the present study, we examined the impact of BAT on seasonal variations of EE/CIT and thermal responses to cold exposure in a randomized crossover design. Forty-five healthy male volunteers participated, and their BAT was assessed by positron emission tomography and computed tomography. CIT, the difference of EE at 27\textdegree C and after 2-h cold exposure at 19\textdegree C, significantly increased in winter compared with summer, being greater in subjects with metabolically active BAT (High BAT, 185.6 kcal/day vs. 18.3 kcal/day, P {$<$} 0.001) than those without (Low BAT, 90.6 kcal/day vs. -46.5 kcal/day, P {$<$} 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis revealed a significant interaction effect between season and BAT on CIT (P {$<$} 0.001). The cold-induced drop of tympanic temperature (Tty) and skin temperature (Tskin) in the forehead region and in the supraclavicular region close to BAT deposits were smaller in the High BAT Group than in the Low BAT Group in winter but not in summer. In contrast, the drop of Tskin in the subclavicular and peripheral regions distant from BAT was similar in the two groups in both seasons. In conclusion, CIT increased from summer to winter in a BAT-dependent manner, paralleling cold-induced changes in Tty/Tskin, indicating a role of BAT in seasonal changes in the thermogenic and thermal responses to cold exposure in humans.},

His conditions were initially diagnosed as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Faciobrachial dystonic seizures, possibly pathognomonic for the VGKCC syndrome, had been misdiagnosed as myoclonus. Treatment led to a complete resolution of his symptoms.Given the similarities of the clinical features and, at times, the neuroimaging findings of VGKCC syndrome to CJD, recognizing VGKCC syndrome and the highly associated and distinctive faciobrachial dystonic seizures is very important. Because this syndrome is the most common treatable condition that mimics CJD, we believe that it is crucial to screen all patients with presumed CJD for this reversible condition.},

However, consumption of fatty fish, the main source of LC n-3-PUFAs is low in Western countries. Intakes of LC n-3-PUFA can be increased by taking dietary supplements, such as fish oil, algal oil, or krill oil. Recently, conflicting information was published on the relative bioavailability of these omega-3 supplements. A few studies suggested that the phospholipid form (krill) is better absorbed than the fish oil ethyl ester (EE) or triglyceride (TG) forms. Yet studies did not match the doses administered nor the concentrations of DHA and EPA per supplement across such comparisons, leading to questionable conclusions. This study was designed to compare the oral bioavailability of the same dose of both EPA and DHA in fish oil-EE vs. fish oil-TG vs. krill oil in plasma at the end of a four-week supplementation. Methods Sixty-six healthy adults (n\,=\,22/arm) were enrolled in a double blind, randomized, three-treatment, multi-dose, parallel study. Subjects were supplemented with a 1.3~g/d dose of EPA\,+\,DHA (approximately 816~mg/d EPA\,+\,522~mg/d DHA, regardless of formulation) for 28 consecutive days, as either fish oil-EE, fish oil-TG or krill oil capsules (6 caps/day). Plasma and red blood cell (RBC) samples were collected at baseline (pre-dose on Day 1) and at 4, 8, 12, 48, 72, 336, and 672~h. Total plasma EPA\,+\,DHA levels at Week 4 (Hour 672) were measured as the primary endpoint. Results No significant differences in total plasma EPA\,+\,DHA at 672~h were observed between fish oil-EE (mean\,=\,90.9\,{$\pm$}\,41 ug/mL), fish oil-TG (mean\,=\,108\,{$\pm$}\,40 ug/mL), and krill oil (mean\,=\,118.5\,{$\pm$}\,48 ug/mL), p\,=\,0.052 and bioavailability differed by {$<$}24~\% between the groups. Additionally, DHA\,+\,EPA levels were not significantly different in RBCs among the 3 formulations, p\,=\,0.19, providing comparable omega-3 indexes. Conclusions Similar plasma and RBC levels of EPA\,+\,DHA were achieved across fish oil and krill oil products when matched for dose, EPA, and DHA concentrations in this four week study, indicating comparable oral bioavailability irrespective of formulation.

The objectives of this study were to review the literature for existing levothyroxine dosing schemes and compare estimation accuracies with novel schemes developed with machine learning. Methods This study retrospectively analyzed 598 patients who attained euthyroidism after total or completion thyroidectomy for benign disease. A scoping review identified existing levothyroxine dosing schemes. Thirteen machine learning algorithms estimated euthyroid dose. Using 10-fold cross-validation, we compared schemes by the proportion of patients having a predicted dose within 12.5 \textmu g/day of their euthyroid dose. Results Of 264 reviewed articles, 7 articles proposed retrospectively implementable dosing schemes. A novel Poisson regression model proved most accurate, correctly predicting 64.8\% of doses. Incorporating 7 variables, Poisson regression was significantly more accurate than the best scheme in the literature (body mass index/weight based) that correctly predicted 60.9\% of doses (P\,=\,.031). Standard weight-based dosing (1.6 \textmu g/kg/day) correctly predicted 51.3\% of doses, and the least effective scheme (age/sex/weight based) correctly predicted 27.4\% of doses. Conclusion Using readily available variables, a novel Poisson regression dosing scheme outperforms other machine learning algorithms and all existing schemes in estimating levothyroxine dose.},

Later in life, deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins is associated with development of atypical retinitis pigmentosa, coagulopathy, posterior column neuropathy and myopathy. ABL results from mutations in the gene encoding the large subunit of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP; OMIM 157147). To date at least 33 MTP mutations have been identified in 43 ABL patients. We describe the clinical progress of two patients, both currently in the fifth decade of life, who were diagnosed with ABL as children and were treated with high oral doses of fat soluble vitamins, including vitamin E over the last three decades. Treatment appears to have been associated with arrest of the neuropathy and other complications in both patients. Because pharmacologic inhibition of MTP is being developed as a novel approach to reduce plasma cholesterol for prevention of cardiovascular disease, defining the long-term clinical features of patients with a natural deficiency in MTP might provide some insight into the possible effects of such treatments. We review the range of clinical, biochemical and molecular perturbations in ABL.},

Multiple US and European clinical studies confirmed that a prebiopsy 4Kscore Test has a high degree of discrimination for a subsequent discovery of high-grade (Gleason score {$\geq$}7) PCa. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the 4Kscore Test to discriminate between patients with and without high-grade PCa based on published clinical validation studies. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the eligible 4Kscore Test clinical validation studies was conducted. The pooled area under the curve (AUC) of the 4Kscore Test as reported from all the studies, and the heterogeneity among these studies were analyzed and repeated for subgroups of the studies. Twelve clinical validation studies were included in the meta-analysis, comprising a total of 11,134 patients. The pooled AUC to discriminate for high-grade PCa for all 12 studies was 0.81 (fixed effects 95\% CI, 0.80-0.83). Restricting the analysis to the six publications that used the contemporary 4Kscore Test algorithm led to very similar results (AUC 0.81; 95\% CI, 0.79-0.83). Heterogeneity was high among all of the 12 studies, as well as among the six publications that used the contemporary 4Kscore Test (Cochrane's Q test, p = 0.001 for both); however, in both cases, after exclusion of a single outlying study with a much lower AUC, heterogeneity was no longer significant (p = 0.08 and p = 0.21). The pooled estimate of 4Kscore Test discrimination (AUC) for high-grade PCa is {$>$}0.80, and is consistent across multiple US and European clinical validation studies.},

Materials and Methods This prospective study enrolled 698 participants without a history of clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) from July 2000 to December 2013 (mean age, 63 years; range, 45 to 84 years; same for men and women). All participants provided written informed consent. CCA wall thickness was measured with US as well as both noncontrast proton-density\textendash weighted and intravenous gadolinium-enhanced MRI. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the associations between wall thickness measurements by using US and MRI with CVD outcomes. Results The adjusted hazard ratios for coronary heart disease, stroke, and CVD associated with per standard deviation increase in intima-media thickness were 1.10, 1.08, and 1.14, respectively. The corresponding associations for mean wall thickness measured with proton-density\textendash weighted MRI were 1.32, 1.48, and 1.37, and for mean wall thickness measured with gadolinium-enhanced MRI were 1.27, 1.58, and 1.38. When included simultaneously in the same model, MRI wall thickness, but not intima-media thickness, remained associated with outcomes. Conclusion For individuals without known cardiovascular disease at baseline, wall thickness measurements by using MRI were more consistently associated with incident cardiovascular disease, particularly stroke, than were intima-media thickness by using US. \textcopyright{} RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Background A recently developing pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 was originated in Wuhan, China, and has quickly spread across the world. We reported the clinical characteristics of 82 death cases with COVID-19 in a single center. Methods Clinical data on 82 death cases laboratory-confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection were obtained from a Wuhan local hospital{${'}$}s electronic medical records according to previously designed standardized data collection forms. Findings All patients were local residents of Wuhan, and the great proportion of them were diagnosed as severe illness when admitted. Most of the death cases were male (65.9\%). More than half of dead patients were older than 60 years (80.5\%) and the median age was 72.5 years. The bulk of death cases had comorbidity (76.8\%), including hypertension (56.1\%), heart disease (20.7\%), diabetes (18.3\%), cerebrovascular disease (12.2\%), and cancer (7.3\%). Respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death (69.5\%), following by sepsis syndrome/MOF (28.0\%), cardiac failure (14.6\%), hemorrhage (6.1\%), and renal failure (3.7\%). Furthermore, respiratory, cardiac, hemorrhage, hepatic, and renal damage were found in 100\%, 89\%, 80.5\%, 78.0\%, and 31.7\% of patients, respectively. On the admission, lymphopenia (89.2\%), neutrophilia (74.3\%), and thrombocytopenia (24.3\%) were usually observed. Most patients had a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of \&gt;5 (94.5\%), high systemic immune-inflammation index of \&gt;500 (89.2\%), increased C-reactive protein level (100\%), lactate dehydrogenase (93.2\%), and D-dimer (97.1\%). A high level of IL-6 (\&gt;10 pg/ml) was observed in all detected patients. Median time from initial symptom to death was 15 days (IQR 11-20), and a significant association between aspartate aminotransferase (p=0.002), alanine aminotransferase (p=0.037) and time from initial symptom to death were interestingly observed. Conclusion Older males with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe disease, even die from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Respiratory failure is the main cause of COVID-19, but either virus itself or cytokine release storm mediated damage to other organ including cardiac, renal, hepatic, and hemorrhage should be taken seriously as well.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Here, we have conducted an online search for all treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA-virus infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19. We suggest that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated before the administration of general treatments and the current children's RNA-virus vaccines including influenza vaccine should be immunized for uninfected people and health care workers. In addition, convalescent plasma should be given to COVID-19 patients if it is available. In conclusion, we suggest that all the potential interventions be implemented to control the emerging COVID-19 if the infection is uncontrollable.},

  abstract = {SFAs play the leading role in 1 of the greatest controversies in nutrition science. Relative to PUFAs, SFAs generally increase circulating concentrations of LDL cholesterol, a risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). However, the purpose of regulatory mechanisms that control the diet-induced lipoprotein cholesterol dynamics is rarely discussed in the context of human adaptive biology. We argue that better mechanistic explanations can help resolve lingering controversies, with the potential to redefine aspects of research, clinical practice, dietary advice, public health management, and food policy. In this paper we propose a novel model, the homeoviscous adaptation to dietary lipids (HADL) model, which explains changes in lipoprotein cholesterol as adaptive homeostatic adjustments that serve to maintain cell membrane fluidity and hence optimal cell function. Due to the highly variable intake of fatty acids in humans and other omnivore species, we propose that circulating lipoproteins serve as a buffer to enable the rapid redistribution of cholesterol molecules between specific cells and tissues that is necessary with changes in dietary fatty acid supply. Hence, circulating levels of LDL cholesterol may change for nonpathological reasons. Accordingly, an SFA-induced raise in LDL cholesterol in healthy individuals could represent a normal rather than a pathologic response. These regulatory mechanisms may become disrupted secondarily to pathogenic processes in association with insulin resistance and the presence of other ASCVD risk factors, as supported by evidence showing diverging lipoprotein responses in healthy individuals as opposed to those with metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and obesity. Corresponding with the model, we suggest alternative contributing factors to the association between elevated LDL cholesterol concentrations and ASCVD, involving dietary factors beyond SFAs, such as an increased endotoxin load from diet-gut microbiome interactions and subsequent chronic low-grade inflammation that interferes with fine-tuned signaling pathways.},

  abstract = {Background Although the effectiveness of statins is well established, analyses of spontaneous adverse event reports have recently questioned the safety of rosuvastatin. Methods and Results We evaluated the risks and benefits of rosuvastatin and compared it with other statins presently on the market. Information was obtained from a search of medical and scientific literature that produced 3001 entries, of which 591 publications containing particularly relevant data were identified, and from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Events Reporting System (AERS) and Spontaneous Reporting System through June 30, 2004. For the AERS data and to control for overreporting in the first postmarketing year and the effect on reporting due to the withdrawal of cerivastatin in 2001, we used the rate of a given adverse event among all adverse events as a measure of risk. We found that adverse effects of rosuvastatin in skeletal muscle, liver, and kidney function did not substantially differ in frequency from those reported for those of other statins in the market in 2004, except for the uncommon development of a mild form of presumably ``tubular'' proteinuria at doses of 40 mg/day or greater. In contrast, cerivastatin had significantly higher rates of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis than rosuvastatin's, but there was no additional effect on renal failure beyond that mediated through rhabdomyolysis. From our literature review, we found that rosuvastatin reduces abnormal lipids on a milligram-per-milligram comparison more than atorvastatin. Conclusion We conclude that rosuvastatin at approved doses incurs no greater risk for adverse events than other marketed statins, except for a mild form of tubular proteinuria when doses at or above the maximum recommended levels ({$\geq$} 40 mg/day) were administered. Its risk-benefit ratio is acceptable when compared with other statins on the market in 2006.},

  title = {{{EPA Assessment}} of {{Risks}} from {{Radon}} in {{Homes}}},
  pages = {98},
  abstract = {Background. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) updates its assessment of health risks from indoor radon, which the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) has determined to be the second leading cause of lung cancer after cigarette smoking. This risk assessment is based primarily on results from a recent study of radon health effects (BEIR VI) by the NAS, with some technical adjustments and extensions. In BEIR VI, the NAS projected 15,400 or 21,800 excess lung cancer deaths in the U.S. each year, using two preferred risk models developed from data from 11 cohorts of miners. Methods. EPA modified and extended the approach used in BEIR VI. First, a single model is constructed that yields numerical results midway between what would be obtained using the two BEIR VI preferred models. Second, noting that the BEIR VI definition of excess risk effectively omits premature deaths caused by radon in people who would otherwise have eventually died of lung cancer, EPA modifies the BEIR VI calculations to include all radon-induced lung cancer deaths. Third, EPA uses more detailed smoking prevalence data and more recent mortality data for its calculations than was used in BEIR VI. Fourth, whereas BEIR VI estimated the fractional increase in lung cancers due to radon, EPA also provides numerical estimates of the risk per unit exposure [lung cancer deaths per working level month (WLM)]. Results. Based on its analysis, EPA estimates that out of a total of 157,400 lung cancer deaths nationally in 1995, 21,100 (13.4\%) were radon related. Among NS, an estimated 26\% were radon related. Estimates of risk per unit exposure are 5.38\texttimes 10-4 per WLM for the U.S. population; 9.68\texttimes 10-4/WLM for ever smokers (ES); and 1.67\texttimes 10-4 per WLM for never smokers (NS). The estimated risks from lifetime exposure at the 4 pCi/L action level are: 2.3\% for the entire population, 4.1\% for ES, and 0.73\% for NS. A Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis that accounts for only those factors that can be quantified without relying too heavily on expert opinion indicates that estimates for the U.S. population and ES may be accurate to within factors of about 2 or 3. Conclusions. The effects of radon and cigarette smoking are synergistic, so that smokers are at higher risk from radon. Consequently, if projected reductions in U.S. smoking rates hold up, some decrease in radon-induced lung cancers is expected, concomitant with decreases in lung cancer, generally; nevertheless, it is anticipated that indoor radon will remain an important public health problem, contributing to thousands of lung cancer deaths annually.},

  abstract = {This evidence- and consensus-based guideline was developed following the methods recommended by Cochrane and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group. The conference was held on 1 December 2016. It is a joint initiative of the Dermatology Section of the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), the EU-founded network of excellence, the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA{$^2$}LEN), the European Dermatology Forum (EDF) and the World Allergy Organization (WAO) with the participation of 48 delegates of 42 national and international societies. This guideline was acknowledged and accepted by the European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS). Urticaria is a frequent, mast cell-driven disease, presenting with wheals, angioedema, or both. The lifetime prevalence for acute urticaria is approximately 20\%. Chronic spontaneous urticaria and other chronic forms of urticaria are disabling, impair quality of life and affect performance at work and school. This guideline covers the definition and classification of urticaria, taking into account the recent progress in identifying its causes, eliciting factors and pathomechanisms. In addition, it outlines evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the different subtypes of urticaria.},

  abstract = {The objective of the study is assessment of the prevalence and type of hypertension in centenarians in Poland. The investigations included 92 people who had turned 100 years of age, who, within the protocol of the Project of Investigation Polish Centenarians, underwent genetic, anthropometric, psychological and sociological examinations, and whose cardiovascular system was assessed. In the present analysis, we are analysing data concerning their blood pressure (BP) assessed by several measurements (3-6) with the mercury sphygmomanometer on both arms in sitting (if possible) or lying position performed during one visit. Hypertension was diagnosed when average BP value exceeded {$>$} or = 160/95 or {$>$} or = 140/90 mmHg. The average of age was 101.2 years (range 100-111 years), the respective values for BP were: systolic 146.7 mmHg (99-213 mmHg), diastolic BP--80.3 mmHg (55-114 mmHg) and pulse pressure (PP) 66.4 mmHg (31-129 mmHg). Hypertension diagnosed based on the criterion {$>$} or = 160/95 mmHg was found in 29\% of subjects, and according to the recent WHO criterion ({$>$} or = 140/90 mmHg) in 65\% of subjects. PP exceeded 65 mmHg in 44.6\%, and was above 50 mmHg in 91\% subjects. In conclusion, hypertension occurs less frequently in centenarians, than in the entire population of old people, but it nevertheless cannot be considered a rare condition.},
