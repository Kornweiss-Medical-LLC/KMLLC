### Emergency Preparedness for the Dental Office
I was recently asked to help with an emergency preparedness plan for a dental office. Dental offices are a relatively common location for medical emergencies such as syncope (fainting) from pain and injections, anaphylaxis (severe allergic reactions) from medications, and other coincidental emergencies that could happen in any place of business such as falls, lacerations, and in a worst case scenario, an airway emergency or cardiac arrest.

### The Bottom Line

If you own a dental practice, not only is it prudent to be prepared for an emergency, but the ADA highly recommends that you're ready when it eventually happens.

You really need 3 main things:

1. Emergency Medications
2. Portable Oxygen & Airway/Ventilation Supplies
3. A simple emergency plan that is regularly drilled

Getting and maintaining equipment is pretty easy now thanks to companies that specialize in doing just that. Being mentally prepared and having a well-drilled plan in your office is likely the most difficult part. Operating under the assumption that even the most knowledgeable, well-drilled, and well-intentioned dental office staff may not feel comfortable with life and death medical emergencies, I'll leave this extremely brief and simple advice based on my training in emergency medicine.

In the case of an unresponsive patient or a dire emergency - do the following:

First, send someone to call 911 immediately, put on protective equipment like gloves, and don't rush into a dangerous scene.

With that out of the way, it's time to rehearse this over and over, ABC, ABC, ABC, ABC, ABC, ABC.

**A** - Airway
**B** - Breathing
**C** - Circulation

Get the patient into a safe position, on their back or side (if regurgitating).

**Airway**

Open the airway by tilting the chin upwards and lifting the jaw by pushing the mandibular angle forward (lifting the soft tissues upwards to open the airway). If the patient has a swollen airway due to anaphylaxis, administer epinephrine. If the airway is blocked by a foreign body, or emesis, suction or manually clear the airway.

As a bonus, if you have the training and wherewithal, you can try placing an oral or nasal airway.

**Breathing**

Check to see if the patient is breathing on their own, if not, send someone to get oxygen, and a bag valve mask and have that person work on initiating bag mask ventilations. Doing this effectively is a skill that requires a lot of practice, but even an imperfect attempt is far better than nothing.

**Circulation**

Feel for a pulse at the carotid artery on the neck. Your tendency will be to push too hard because you'll be stressed. Press gently at first and slowly add pressure until you feel a pulse. If you do not feel one, begin chest compressions at a rate of 120 compressions per minute (in medical school we're taught this is the pace of the song "Stayin' Alive" - I've sung this song in my head during every resuscitation in which I've done compressions). There is a tendency to delay chest compressions because you think it's unnecessary or too drastic - it isn't. If the patient is not responding, and you don't feel a pulse, don't hesitate, just do the compressions. If they merely fainted - they'll quickly let you know. Keep going until you feel a little bit tired, and then switch out with someone else. Do this continuously. Don't stop. It's likely the only effective thing you're doing that may give the patient a chance to survive.

If you have the wherewithal, there is one more mnemonic to try to remember: GON, GON, GON, GON, GON, GON.

**G** - glucose
**O** - oxygen
**N** - naloxone

These are the three most common reasons that someone becomes unconscious - low blood sugar, low oxygen levels, opiate overdose. The antidotes are glucose, oxygen, and naloxone (antidote for opiates like heroin, oxycodone, morphine, etc.). If you're going to supply any of these, you need to have them on hand, and you need to know how to give them.  That's where this next section comes in.

### Do It the Easy Way

Fortunately, a company named **[HealthFirst](https://www.healthfirst.com/)** has you covered.

You can have everything you need: medications, oxygen, and first-aid supplies for roughly \$$1400$ up front and then an annual fee for their [practice partner program](https://www.healthfirst.com/practice-partner) which will help keep your medications up to date and dispose of old medications, and will also give you access to an on-call emergency physician by phone to talk you through emergencies. These cost of these services are included in the initial purchase and then charged annually thereafter - they don't advertise this annual fee, but you can contact a rep at 1-800-331-1984 for more information

This kit doesn't include an AED, glucometer, or a pulse oximeter, all of which I recommend.

### Do It the Hard Way

You could put together your own kit, which is unlikely to be organized as well as the kit supplied by HealthFirst, and will definitely be more work to maintain. You'll save a few hundred dollars up front, but it's unlikely to be cost or time effective on the back end - maintenance will be difficult and potentially costly.

If you want to proceed, here's what you'll need:
