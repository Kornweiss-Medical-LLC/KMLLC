# Family History

We have several options for providing family history. Kornweiss Medical is trialing a new product called FamGenix, which is a pedigree and risk assessment platform. FamGenix allows you to collaborate with family members to build and update your family history, and to own that history so that you can share it with any practice, health system, or doctor in the future. 

Dr. Kornweiss recommends using this platform. Instructions are below, as well as alternatives.

If you’d like to learn more about FamGenix, follow this [link](https://famgenix.com/).
