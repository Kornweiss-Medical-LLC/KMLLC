A True and Unusual Story of Appendicitis
</p>

<!-- insert body of document -->
There was once a young healthy man. He went to work, ate healthy food, and exercised daily. One night, the man was preparing for bed when he noticed some mild discomfort around his belly button. He didn't think much of it. He pushed on it a bit and it felt better, so he went to bed. In the middle of the night, the man woke up feeling hot and restless. This didn't happen to the man very often; but after shedding his blanket, he easily went back to sleep. In the morning, the man bathed, dressed, and went to work. At work, he ate a breakfast of sausage, eggs, and potatoes, and drank a coffee. About an hour after breakfast, the man noticed slight pain deep in his abdomen. It didn't hurt too badly; he thought he needed merely to use the bathroom; but after doing so, the pain did not improve.

The man wasn't sure what was wrong, but luckily, he worked in a hospital. So, he consulted a doctor, and thus became a patient. The doctor pressed on the patient's abdomen. When the doctor pressed on a spot between the patient's groin and his belly button on the right side, the patient felt a sharp pain.

Then, the doctor brought an ultrasound machine into the room (the same type of machine that's used to perform sonograms of pregnancies).  The doctor placed the ultrasound probe on the patient's abdomen and noticed a tubular structure. On the black and white screen, the tube looked like a white circle with a black circle around it. Inside the white circle was another white semicircle with a black shadow behind it.

The doctor explained that the outer black circle was fluid surrounding a special part of the bowel called the appendix. "The appendix," the doctor went on, "is a small tube of bowel that sticks out from the cecum, which is the junction between the colon (large bowel) and the small bowel.

On the screen of the ultrasound machine, the doctor pointed to a white circle, the appendix, and the semicircle inside of it, a stone. The doctor explained that stones can form in the appendix when stool gets stuck in the appendix and calcify over time. The doctor said, this is appendicitis. It's a condition that can occur when the appendix is clogged and becomes swollen and infected.

But then, the doctor said he was surprised that the patient didn't seem to be in much pain. He also didn't have a fever, nausea, or vomiting, symptoms typical of appendicitis. The doctor was also surprised that the patient didn't seem to feel that sick. In fact, the patient was able to continue working. So, the doctor was not certain of the diagnosis. He consulted a second doctor.

The second doctor was a more experienced doctor. The second doctor took one look at the patient and said, "this man does __not__ have appendicitis." The second doctor observed that the patient was still walking around instead of sitting still. The second doctor explained, when the appendix is inflamed, it causes inflammation of the lining of the abdominal cavity (called the peritoneum - seen outlined in red below in this drawing of a cross-section of an abdominal cavity from Gray's Anatomy).

When the peritoneum is inflamed, it's very painful to move. The first doctor showed the ultrasound to the second doctor. Both doctors agreed that more information was needed.

So, the doctor ordered a CT scan. A CT scan is a cross-sectional image formed by using an x-ray gun which rotates around the patient and shoots x-rays through the patient at different angles. The computer takes the data from each angle and computes a series of images which appear flat on a screen, but when viewed by a doctor who is specially trained to interpret CT scans (and other radiographs), called a "radiologist," the series of images provides a 3-dimensional visualization of the inside of the patient's body.

On the CT scan, the doctor was able to see a very swollen, enlarged appendix with a big stone in the middle. He could also see signs of inflammation around the appendix. The CT scan revealed that the patient *__did__* have appendicitis.

### Why is this an unusual case?

The doctor and the patient in this case were both me! I diagnosed my own case of appendicitis while working a shift in the emergency department.

### What happened?

After I made the diagnosis, I decided to have my appendix removed surgically. Prior to this ordeal, I had always thought that if I had appendicitis, I would choose antibiotics over surgery, but once I learned that my appendix was obstructed by a stone, I decided that the risk of antibiotics failing and my appendix subsequently rupturing outweighed the risk of surgery.

If the appendix ruptures, stool and infectious material leak into the abdominal cavity often causing an abscess to form. This usually requires hospitalization and surgical drains, as well as prolonged courses of antibiotics. It can also cause surgery to become more complicated. The healing process from the infection can cause scarring, and adhesions around the bowels, which can lead to bowel obstructions in the future if loops of bowel become strangulated by the scar tissue. I really did not want this to happen.

*Why I didn't want to lose my appendix*

Most people believe that the appendix serves no known function. I remember being taught about vestigial organs in middle school. The appendix was used as an example. But, the appendix likely serves an important role in gastrointestinal immunity. The appendix is a blind loop of bowel that is associated with immune tissue and is populated with potentially beneficial bacteria [[1]]. At least one study has found an association of appendectomy with increased risk of colorectal cancer [[2]], while another did not [[3]]. Last, while uncommon, there is a chance of surgical complication with any surgery, however routine.

### How was my appendectomy performed and how was my post-operative course?

Before my operation, I met my anesthesiologist. She explained that I would undergo general anesthesia. I would be injected with medications and inhale gases to render me unconscious. Then, I would be given a medication to paralyze me, and a breathing tube would be placed into my trachea. I would be connected to a ventilator. This is all done to decrease the risk that I might move while the surgeon is operating. The anesthesiologist can also keep me sedated by pumping inhaled anesthetic gas through the ventilation circuit.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Maquet_Flow-I_anesthesia_machine.jpg/1200px-Maquet_Flow-I_anesthesia_machine.jpg)

Next, my surgeon explained that he would perform a laparoscopic appendectomy. He indicated that he would make 3 small incisions on my abdomen, each about one inch long - one by the belly button (umbilicus), one over the bladder, and one by the left groin. Through each incision, the surgeon said he would insert a different device. The incision by the umbilicus would be used for a small camera. Using the camera, the surgeon would be able to see inside my abdomen. Next, he would inflate my abdomen like a balloon by pumping carbon dioxide in through one of the ports. Next, he would insert graspers to move my bowels in order to find my appendix. And, finally, the surgeon said he would use a special tool which removes the appendix and seals the opening (where the appendix used to be) with staples. The appendix would be removed through one of the ports, the gas evacuated from my abdomen, and the incisions closed with suture and glue.

The procedure went as planned, and I woke up an hour later in the anesthesia care unit for recovery. Sixty minute later, I was being driven home.

For the next seven days, I nursed myself back to health. I checked my incisions every day for signs of infection, like worsening pain, redness, or tenderness. I took pictures of them daily so that I could compare one day to the next. I took a stool softener called polyethylene glycol to keep my bowels soft. On the third day after surgery, my bowels regained normal function. I walked every day for at least 30 minutes, but usually more than an hour. I slept, a lot. And, I ate healthy food; eggs, rice, meat, bits of bread and vegetables, and fish.  I drank plenty of water, some tea, and a little bit of coffee. I did not take any medication at all. My abdomen felt swollen and heavy every day, and I often had sharp pains deep within my abdomen. This improved a little bit each day.  The pain was never so bad that it was intolerable, but it was scary. I worried that something was still wrong every time I felt pain.

On day six, I received a message from the hospital. Another doctor, a doctor called a pathologist examined my appendix. Pathologists are specially trained to examine biopsies (tissue samples) and also to perform whole autopsies (examination of dead people) to find out what is (or was) wrong. The pathologist determined that I definitely had appendicitis by looking at the appendix with his naked eye, and by examining thin slices of the appendix under a microscope.

By the seventh day, I was able to sit up and down with ease. I had little to no pain, but still did not feel 100% normal. By day eight, I was able to work with no problems.

### Being sick is scary.

Having surgery was, and still is, one of my biggest fears. As an emergency physician, I only see patients after an operation if something goes wrong. Most patients do not have complications from surgery, because most surgeons are very good at what they do. These patients do not come to the ER, because they do well and follow-up in surgery clinics. I only see patients that do poorly, and so, my professional view of surgery is colored in this way. I know of nearly every complication that can happen in a surgery like this, so the fact that I am now 3 weeks post-op and have no complications at this point is a huge relief, and due in no small part to the brilliant work of generations of doctors and scientists, and most importantly, it is due to the professional work of my surgical team and the hospital staff, who ensure the sterility of the operating room and the equipment, and how actually deliver the medical care.

### I am endlessly thankful for my medical team.

There were six doctors involved in my care, two CT technologists, at least six nurses, and several other assistants. Tiny mistakes in diagnosis or treatment, or just bad luck, such as an allergy to a medication, can cause a major problem. If someone doesn't follow proper sterile processing procedures, or doesn't measure medications properly in the pharmacy, serious complications can occur. Even if every single person and piece of equipment perform perfectly, there is no guarantee that something still won't go wrong. Cutting out organs and keeping someone alive while they're paralyzed are incredible feats of engineering, training, focus, and active thought. I do not take these achievements for granted.

### I learned many other lessons from this ordeal.

**It feels bad when your doctor doesn't listen to you.**

In my case, it didn't matter much, because I was both patient and doctor, and I was fairly certain of my own diagnosis. But, ultimately it was upsetting that the other doctor didn't listen to me (in all fairness, this other doctor did listen, and he knew from the outset that I was going to have a CT scan, so this is not a great example, and certainly is not a criticism of him or any of my other colleagues). But, it was a good reminder that, doctors, like everyone else, sometimes don't listen adequately. When a patient tells me something is wrong, I believe them, and now with renewed vigor. Mistakes still happen, but most are avoidable merely by listening intently to patients.

[Sir William Osler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Osler), Canadian Physician, one of four founding professors of Johns Hopkins Hospital, who has frequently been described as the Father of Modern Medicine and one of the "greatest diagnosticians ever to wield a stethoscope." [[4]], said "Listen to your patient, he is telling you the diagnosis." In my case, this was literally true. But, when Osler said this, what he meant was that when patients describe their symptoms, they are giving the doctor clues to their diagnosis. It is the doctor's job to listen very carefully, to interpret what the patient says, and most of all, to think deeply. The physician who disregards or fails to hear a patient's symptoms puts both the patient and themselves in great peril.

**Be nice to everyone all the time.**

Imagine that you weren't very nice to someone, and now they're performing surgery on you. This is an especially good reminder for people who work in medicine - what if I had just treated my surgical colleague poorly the day before, and now I need his help? Even though I am sure he would have done his best work anyway, it's impossible to not feel some bias as a human being. Surgeons are humans. I've seen patients berate their caretakers on many occasions, and each time, I try to remind them that, even if they have legitimate reasons for their anger, as a patient, your health, and quite possibly, your life, may depend on the actions of your medical team. I do not mean to suggest that a nurse or doctor would intentionally harm a patient out of revenge. But, it's conceivable they may be distracted by an adversarial relationship instead of devoting all mental and physical energy to making the right diagnosis or delivering the optimal treatment. Most people do not have the luxury of choosing their medical team, especially in an emergency situation. Even if you are legitimately wronged, or treated poorly, just be nice anyway. You can disagree, make requests, and speak firmly, but anger and disrespect will not benefit you. If you're not in an emergency situation, and you are wronged by your medical team, then look for a new team, or seek to repair the relationship.

**Being a patient is scary.**

I learned what the psychological fear of patient-hood feels like. I know that an appendectomy is one of the simplest operations, and that mine in particular was extremely straightforward. But, I cannot help but think that every post-op twinge and pain is from an abscess, a hernia, or some other disaster that will ultimately lead to complication after complication. Because of my profession, I can quite rapidly invoke mental images of cascades of surgical and medical disasters resulting in my disability or demise. For those who work outside the medical profession, the terror might be even worse, because the unknown can be the scariest thing of all. For me, I can at least make reasonable interpretations of my pain. But for those without medical training, the imagination can run wild. Doctors should do better to recognize that most patients just want to understand what's going on. People don't expect miracles. Diagnosis and prognosis go quite a long way even when treatment options are limited.

**Good health begets good health.**

I reinforced what I already knew about health. One important reason to optimize my health on a daily basis is to cope with unexpected challenges like this. I thought because of my healthy diet and regular bowels (sorry if that's too much information) that I would never have appendicitis. But, I got it anyway. The good news is that my body was prepared for an insult. What if I had not been in good health? What might have been different?

I may not have been able to examine my abdomen or ultrasound it easily if I was not reasonably thin, which might have delayed my diagnosis. A delayed diagnosis could have resulted in a ruptured appendix. It would have been more difficult for the nurse to insert an IV to draw blood and administer medications if I did not have lean arms and well hydrated veins. My surgeon may have had more trouble accessing my abdomen to perform surgery, and the operation may have been more difficult if I had visceral fat (fat around my bowels and internal organs). My wounds and bowels might have recovered more slowly if I had poor nutrition or ongoing inflammation. My bowels might have recovered more slowly if I was not able to get restful sleep or be active after surgery. I might have suffered a wound infection if I had high blood sugar levels, or unhealthy blood vessels. I might have developed pneumonia or blood clots. My anesthesiologist might have had more difficulty placing a breathing tube and dosing my anesthesia. I might have stayed in the operating room longer and in the hospital longer to recover from anesthesia if I was overweight (some anesthetics are absorbed by fat tissue and take longer to leave the body of patients with more fat tissue). Poor nutritional status and lack of abdominal wall musculature could predispose to hernias that could require a second operation.

I could go on with these examples. The point is, if there is no other reason, consider optimizing your health because, one day it may mean the difference between life and death when you require a routine operation, or obtain a common infection, or even a novel infection like Covid-19 or the next strain of influenza. I am 34 years old, and in the best shape of my life, and it still took me 10 days to recover from a relatively minor surgery. On day 21, my incisions have still not *completely* healed. I am using myself as an example solely to emphasize how important it is to be as healthy as possible so that you can withstand unforeseen but inevitable threats to your health.

### Here are some things that I did to try to recover more quickly.

There are a few trite recommendations that you'll hear doctors enumerate for nearly every condition. They're also the same things you'll hear from your family and friends. These recommendations are so general and commonplace, that they're often under-weighted or ignored completely, but they shouldn't be.

How many times have you heard to "get plenty of rest, drink lots of water, and be active, but not too active?"

Because this advice is repeated so often, and is usually unquantified, it sounds unimportant, but it is crucial.

### Sleep
I did sleep a lot. I slept more than fourteen hours the first day after surgery, and twelve hours the next. I slept at least eight hours a night for the next two or three days after that. I think a decent way to think about how much to sleep when ill or recovering from surgery, is simply not to limit your sleep the way we usually do with imposed schedules and alarms, if possible. Allow your body to regulate your sleep naturally.

### Hydration 
I hydrated by drinking enough to make me urinate a full bladder of clear to light-yellow urine every 2-4 hours while awake. If I went longer than that without the urge to urinate, or when I urinated it was less than a "full bladder," or had a dark yellow color, I drank more. Hydrating cannot be done with just plain water, especially when you are not eating enough food, which is common during illness or after surgery. If you have normal kidneys, hydration is best achieved with adequate salt (sodium-chloride) intake. Other electrolytes like potassium and magnesium can be helpful as well. I have several products on my website that I use for hydration.

### Activity
It's extremely important to walk after surgery. I didn't walk as much as I should have. I really didn't feel like getting off of the couch. I forced myself to walk 30-60 minutes per day, though. Walking helps get the bowels moving, it avoid the development of blood clots and pneumonia, and it can prevent a decline in cardiopulmonary fitness. I was shocked by my degree of exhaustion and how quickly I became detrained after surgery.
