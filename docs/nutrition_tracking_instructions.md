# Nutrition Tracking Instructions

**Use the Cronometer App**

I recommend using the [web app](https://cronometer.com/) (cronometer.com) on your computer if you’re eating most meals at home. If you’re not at home, the iPhone and Android apps work well.

**Record everything you eat and drink**

The app is fairly straightforward to use, but you can watch these videos to learn how to record food:

**Don’t change your diet**

Record your current diet as-is. Do not change your current diet while tracking. The purpose is to understand your current nutrition as accurately as possible.

**Select generic items, not branded items**

When entering food items into Cronometer, select the most generic version of the food possible. (e.g. if you eat a burger from McDonald's, don't select "McDonald's burger." Instead, select "burger." The food databases contain richer nutrition information for generic items as against branded items.

**Weigh or measure your food**

Weigh, measure, or estimate portions as accurately as possible. I highly recommend buying a kitchen scale for this purpose if you don’t already have one.

**Record individual ingredients**

If you eat a meal consisting of several ingredients, ideally, enter each ingredient separately.

**Record everything**

Be sure to include condiments, sauces, dips, and added salt to your tracking.

**Take Notes**

The Cronometer app has a note feature that allows you to add notes to your daily nutrition journal. You can use this feature to add information about how certain foods make you feel.
