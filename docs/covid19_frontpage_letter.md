# Covid-19 Welcome Letter to Visitors

Dear Visitor,

The novel coronavirus (Sars-CoV-2), which causes the disease entity known as Covid-19, has captured the minds of the world. Most of our lives are disrupted. We have transitioned from "normal mode" to "survival mode." We wake up in the morning thinking about the virus, spend most of the day talking and reading about it, and go to bed with it on our minds as well. This is necessary to a degree. But, I've realized that at some point, thinking can become aimless rumination if we are not careful. To avoid the self-imprisonment of worry and anxiety, I have aimed myself at learning as much as possible with the specific goal of finding actionable intelligence and delivering it to those I care for. I am also turning my mind towards the future, and avoiding the trap of thinking only on the range of the moment, as opposed to planning for a lifetime of happiness, which most of us will live to achieve.

I am doing my best to distill and present high-quality, useful, pointed, and timely information that can help us through this situation as easily and as safely as possible. I am also focusing on positive information and long-term planning that can help us position ourselves to do well as life returns to normal. Please send me questions, comments, corrections and feedback at <feedback@kornweissmedical.com>.

Sincerely,\
Steve
