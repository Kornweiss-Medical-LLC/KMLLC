  abstract = {Background Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the commonest endocrine disturbance affecting women in the reproductive age group and encompasses signs of hyperandrogenism, menstrual cycle disturbances and obesity. Some of the symptoms of PCOS may be ameliorated by the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP). Methods A pilot observational study was carried out in a university teaching hospital setting to determine whether the clinical and biochemical features of PCOS are ameliorated by a new COCP, Yasmin\textregistered, which contains a new progestogen, drosperinone. Treatment with Yasmin was given for 6 months to 17 patients. Results Thirteen patients (76\%) completed 6 months of therapy. Good cycle control was achieved in all patients. Percentage body fat increased, with no overall change in body mass index. Fasting insulin and triglyceride concentrations rose significantly. Serum total testosterone concentrations fell with a concomitant rise in sex hormone binding globulin levels. Hirsutism scores did not change significantly in the 12 women who were clinically hirsute. There was, however, a significant improvement in the acne scores. Four of the 17 patients dropped out of the trial between Cycles 3 and 5 due to side effects. Conclusions Yasmin provides good cycle control for women with PCOS, with an improvement in acne over 6 months but not in other symptoms of the syndrome. Key message points  Yasmin provides control of the menstrual cycle in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).  Acne improves, and hirsutism and BMI do not change, in women prescribed Yasmin for PCOS.},

  abstract = {Caffeine is a commonly used neurostimulant that also produces cerebral vasoconstriction by antagonizing adenosine receptors. Chronic caffeine use results in an adaptation of the vascular adenosine receptor system presumably to compensate for the vasoconstrictive effects of caffeine. We investigated the effects of caffeine on cerebral blood flow (CBF) in increasing levels of chronic caffeine use. Low (mean = 45 mg/day), moderate (mean = 405 mg/day), and high (mean = 950 mg/day) caffeine users underwent quantitative perfusion magnetic resonance imaging on four separate occasions: twice in a caffeine abstinent state (abstained state) and twice in a caffeinated state following their normal caffeine use (native state). In each state, there were two drug conditions: participants received either caffeine (250 mg) or placebo. Gray matter CBF was tested with repeated-measures analysis of variance using caffeine use as a between-subjects factor, and correlational analyses were conducted between CBF and caffeine use. Caffeine reduced CBF by an average of 27\% across both caffeine states. In the abstained placebo condition, moderate and high users had similarly greater CBF than low users; but in the native placebo condition, the high users had a trend towards less CBF than the low and moderate users. Our results suggest a limited ability of the cerebrovascular adenosine system to compensate for high amounts of daily caffeine use. Hum Brain Mapp 2009. \textcopyright{} 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Importance: Patients in long-term care facilities (LTCF) are at a high-risk of contracting COVID-19 due to advanced age and multiple comorbidities. Without effective treatments, outbreaks in such facilities will become commonplace and will result in severe morbidity and mortality. The effectiveness of doxycycline (DOXY) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) combination therapy in high risk COVID-19 patients in long-term care facilities is not yet understood. Objective: The goal of this analysis is to describe outcomes after use of DOXY-HCQ combination in high-risk COVID-19 patients in LTCF. Design: Case-series analysis. Setting: Three (3) LTCFs in New York. Participants: From March 19 to March 30, 2020, fifty-four (54) patients, residents of three (3) LTCFs in New York and diagnosed (confirmed or presumed) with COVID-19, were included in this analysis. Exposure: All patients who were diagnosed (confirmed or presumed) with COVID-19 received DOXY-HCQ combination therapy along with standard of care. Main Outcomes and Measures: Patients characteristics, clinical recovery, radiological improvements, medication side-effects, hospital transfer, and death were assessed as outcome measures. Results: A series of fifty-four (54) high-risk patients, who developed a sudden onset of fever, cough, and shortness of breath (SOB) and were diagnosed or presumed to have COVID-19, were started with a combination of DOXY-HCQ and 85\% (n=46) patients showed clinical recovery defined as: resolution of fever and SOB, or a return to baseline setting if patients are ventilator-dependent. A total of 11\% (n=6) patients were transferred to acute care hospitals due to clinical deterioration and 6\% (n=3) patients died in the facilities. Naive Indirect Comparison suggests these data were significantly better outcomes than the data reported in MMWR (reported on March 26, 2020) from a long-term care facility in King County, Washington where 57\% patients were hospitalized, and 22\% patients died. Conclusion: The clinical experience of this case series indicates DOXY-HCQ treatment in high-risk COVID-19 patients is associated with a reduction in clinical recovery, decreased transfer to hospital and decreased mortality were observed after treatment with DOXY-HCQ.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Background: Chest CT is used for diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), as an important complement to the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. Purpose: To investigate the diagnostic value and consistency of chest CT as compared with comparison to RT-PCR assay in COVID-19. Methods: From January 6 to February 6, 2020, 1014 patients in Wuhan, China who underwent both chest CT and RT-PCR tests were included. With RT-PCR as reference standard, the performance of chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 was assessed. Besides, for patients with multiple RT-PCR assays, the dynamic conversion of RT-PCR results s (negative to positive, positive to negative, respectively) was analyzed as compared with serial chest CT scans for those with time-interval of 4 days or more. s Results: Of 1014 patients, 59\% (601/1014) had positive RT-PCR results, and 88\% (888/1014) had positive chest CT scans. The sensitivity of chest CT in suggesting COVID-19 was 97\% (95\%CI, 95-98\%, 580/601 patients) based on positive RT-PCR re results. In patients with negative RT-PCR results, 75\% (308/413) had positive chest CT findings; of 308, 48\% were considered as highly likely cases, with 33\% as probable cases. By analysis of serial RT-PCR assays and CT scans, the mean interval time between the initial negative to positive RT-PCR results was 5.1 {$\pm$} 1.5 days; the initial positive to subsequent negative RT-PCR result was 6.9 {$\pm$} 2.3 days). 60\% to 93\% of P cases had initial positive CT consistent with COVID-19 prior (or parallel) to the initial positive RT-PCR results. 42\% (24/57) cases showed improvement in follow-up chest CT scans before the RT-PCR results turning negative. Conclusion: Chest CT has a high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19. Chest CT may be considered as a primary tool for the current COVID-19 detection in epidemic Inareas.},

However, intranasal zinc has been reported as a cause of anosmia in humans and animals. Seventeen patients presenting with anosmia after the use of intranasal zinc gluconate are described. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective case series of patients presenting to a nasal dysfunction clinic and conducted complete history and physical examination on all patients, including nasal endoscopy. All patients underwent detailed odor threshold and identification testing. RESULTS: Threshold and identification testing revealed impaired olfaction in all patients. Inflammatory and traumatic causes of anosmia were excluded based on history, physical examination, and imaging. All patients diagnosed with zinc-induced anosmia or hyposmia reported sniffing deeply when applying the gel. This was followed by an immediate sensation of burning lasting minutes to hours. Loss of sense of smell was then perceived within 48 hours. Seven of 17 patients never developed symptoms of an upper respiratory infection. CONCLUSIONS: The zinc-induced anosmia syndrome, characterized by squirt, sniff, burn, and anosmia, occurs after the exposure of olfactory epithelium to zinc cation. It can be distinguished from postviral anosmia based on history.},

  abstract = {Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Due to its complexity in nature, effective breast cancer treatment can encounter many challenges. Traditional methods of cancer detection such as tissue biopsy are not comprehensive enough to capture the entire genomic landscape of breast tumors. However, with the introduction of novel techniques, the application of liquid biopsy has been enhanced, enabling the improvement of various aspects of breast cancer management including early diagnosis and screening, prediction of prognosis, early detection of relapse, serial sampling and efficient longitudinal monitoring of disease progress and response to treatment. Various components of tumor cells released into the blood circulation can be analyzed in liquid biopsy sampling, some of which include circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), cell-free RNA, tumor-educated platelets and exosomes. These components can be utilized for different purposes. As an example, ctDNA can be sequenced for genetic profiling of the tumors to enhance individualized treatment and longitudinal screening. CTC plasma count analysis or ctDNA detection after curative tumor resection surgery could facilitate early detection of minimal residual disease, aiding in the initiation of adjuvant therapy to prevent recurrence. Furthermore, CTC plasma count can be assessed to determine the stage and prognosis of breast cancer. In this review, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the various components of liquid biopsy used in breast cancer diagnosis and will expand on aspects that require further focus in future research.},

Baseline total calcium intake was assessed from diet (using a food frequency questionnaire) and calcium supplements (by a medication inventory) and categorized into quintiles. Baseline CAC was measured by computed tomography, and CAC measurements were repeated in 2742 participants {$\approx$}10~years later. At baseline, mean calcium intakes across quintiles were 313.3, 540.3, 783.0, 1168.9, and 2157.4~mg/day. Women had higher calcium intakes than men. After adjustment for potential confounders, among 1567 participants without baseline CAC, the relative risk (RR) of developing incident CAC over 10~years, by quintile 1 to 5 of calcium intake, were 1 (reference), 0.95 (0.79\textendash 1.14), 1.02 (0.85\textendash 1.23), 0.86 (0.69\textendash 1.05), and 0.73 (0.57\textendash 0.93). After accounting for total calcium intake, calcium supplement use was associated with increased risk for incident CAC (RR=1.22 [1.07\textendash 1.39]).

Design: Multi-center retrospective observational study. Setting: The Henry Ford Health System (HFHS) in Southeast Michigan: large six hospital integrated health system; the largest of hospitals is an 802-bed quaternary academic teaching hospital in urban Detroit, Michigan. Participants: Consecutive patients hospitalized with a COVID-related admission in the health system from March 10, 2020 to May 2, 2020 were included. Only the first admission was included for patients with multiple admissions. All patients evaluated were 18 years of age and older and were treated as inpatients for at least 48 h unless expired within 24 h. Exposure: Receipt of hydroxychloroquine alone, hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin, azithromycin alone, or neither. Main outcome: The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Results: Of 2,541 patients, with a median total hospitalization time of 6 days (IQR: 4\textendash 10 days), median age was 64 years (IQR:53\textendash 76 years), 51\% male, 56\% African American, with median time to follow-up of 28.5 days (IQR:3\textendash 53). Overall in-hospital mortality was 18.1\% (95\% CI:16.6\%\textendash 19.7\%); by treatment: hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin, 157/783 (20.1\% [95\% CI: 17.3\%\textendash 23.0\%]), hydroxychloroquine alone, 162/1202 (13.5\% [95\% CI: 11.6\%\textendash 15.5\%]), azithromycin alone, 33/147 (22.4\% [95\% CI: 16.0\%\textendash 30.1\%]), and neither drug, 108/409 (26.4\% [95\% CI: 22.2\%\textendash 31.0\%]). Primary cause of mortality was respiratory failure (88\%); no patient had documented torsades de pointes. From Cox regression modeling, predictors of mortality were age{$>$}65 years (HR:2.6 [95\% CI:1.9\textendash 3.3]), white race (HR:1.7 [95\% CI:1.4\textendash 2.1]), CKD (HR:1.7 [95\%CI:1.4\textendash 2.1]), reduced O2 saturation level on admission (HR:1.5 [95\%CI:1.1\textendash 2.1]), and ventilator use during admission (HR: 2.2 [95\%CI:1.4\textendash 3.3]). Hydroxychloroquine provided a 66\% hazard ratio reduction, and hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin 71\% compared to neither treatment (p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusions and relevance: In this multi-hospital assessment, when controlling for COVID-19 risk factors, treatment with hydroxychloroquine alone and in combination with azithromycin was associated with reduction in COVID-19 associated mortality. Prospective trials are needed to examine this impact.},

Generally, it is recognized as a safe agent for ovulation induction, but rarely, it is associated with life-threatening conditions. A 36-year-old woman who had been prescribed clomiphene citrate for infertility was admitted to the emergency department for chest pain lasting for 2 hours. She had no history of smoking, and she did not have any cardiac risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI). An electrocardiogram performed on admission revealed ST-elevation in the precordial leads. She was taken to the catheter laboratory for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and the coronary angiography revealed total occlusion of the midportion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) with a heavy thrombus burden. The circumflex and right coronary arteries were normal. After balloon dilatation, a 2.75x15-mm drug eluting stent was implanted in the mid part of the LAD. The patient had an uncomplicated recovery. Before discharge, echocardiography revealed apical akinesis; anterior and lateral hypokinesis; and an ejection fraction of 45\% with mild mitral regurgitation. Although clomiphene citrate is a relatively safe drug for ovarian stimulation, it has been associated with serious side effects, such as MI. Physicians should be aware of the potential risks of clomiphene citrate, especially in patients with risk factors for coronary artery disease.},

Dosing a statin (rosuvastatin) every other ing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and reducing cardiovascular events. Overall, these agents have a remarkable safety profile, although some patients are intolerant of them. Common reasons for discontinuation of statin therapy include elevated hepatic enzyme levels, gastrointestinal complaints, and ``statin myopathy,'' which inday (EOD) may provide significant lipoprotein changes while avoiding common adverse effects in this statin-intolerant population. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect and tolerance of EOD rosuvastatin in patients previously intolerant to statin therapy. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients treated with EOD rosuvastatin at 2 lipid specialty clinics: the University of Kansas Lipid, Atherosclerosis, and LDL-Apheresis Center and the Hartford Hospital Cholesterol Management Center. Approximately 2600 charts were reviewed to identify patients receiving rosuvastatin EOD who previously had experienced statin intolerance. Fiftyone patients were eligible for the analysis, which evaluated changes in the lipid cludes myalgia, weakness, cramping, and rhabdomyolysis.1 Nonspecific muscle complaints or joint pain without elevated creatine kinase levels have been reported in approximately 5\% of clinical trial participants2; however, the range is wide (0.3\textendash 33\%).3 An observational study, the profile, the number achieving their low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals, and the percent tolerating rosuvastatin EOD. Laboratory data were assessed immediately prior to rosuvastatin EOD therapy and at the first follow-up. RESULTS: Myalgias (76.5\%) and increased transaminase levels (19.5\%) were the most common causes of prior statin intolerance, but 72.5\% (37/51) of patients were able to tolerate the EOD therapy (mean dose 5.6 mg) regimen for 4 {$\pm$} 2.9 (mean {$\pm$} SD) months. Mean LDL-C decreased 34.5\% (p {$<$} 0.001) in the patients who tolerated the regimen, enabling approximately 50\% to achieve their LDL-C PRIMO (Prediction of Muscular Risk in Observational conditions), reported muscle complaints in 10.5\% of the 7924 statin-treated subjects,4 suggesting that statin-induced myopathy is considerably more frequent in clinical practice. A number of other drugs (eg, bile acid resins, ezetimibe, niacin) are available to reduce LDL-C in patients who are statin goal. All patients who were considered to be intolerant to rosuvastatin EOD therapy (27.5\%; 14/51) reexperienced the symptoms of their prior statin intolerance. CONCLUSIONS: Treating patients intolerant to statins with rosuvastatin EOD was tolerated by the majority of patients and reduced LDL-C in our study. This dosing strategy may be useful in patients intolerant to once-daily statin dosing, although such an approach has not been documented to reduce cardiovascular events.},

The range of triggering physical activities is broad, including as mild an effort as a stroll. EIA is not fully repeatable (ie, the same exercise may not always result in anaphylaxis in a given patient). In FDEIA, the combined ingestion of sensitizing food and exercise is necessary to precipitate symptoms. Clinical features and management do not differ significantly from other types of anaphylaxis. The pathophysiology of EIA and FDEIA is not fully understood. Different hypotheses concerning the possible influence of exercise on the development of anaphylactic symptoms are taken into consideration.

Hamstring and calf muscles were evaluated through the straight leg elevation test, popliteal angle test, and ankle dorsiflexion (knee extended and with the knee flexed). All variables were compared between the 2 groups. In addition, ROC curves, sensitivity, and specificity of the muscle contraction tests were also calculated to determine their potential predictive powers.Results:Differences between the 2 groups for the tests used to assess muscular shortening were significant (P {$<$} .001) in all cases. The straight leg elevation test and ankle dorsiflexion with the knee extended presented respective sensitivities of 94\% and 100\% and specificities of 82\% and 96\% as diagnostic tests for the participants in this study.Conclusion:Tightness of the posterior muscles of the lower limb was present in the plantar fasciitis patients, but not in the unaffected participants.Clinical Relevance:The results of this study suggest that therapists who are going to employ a stretching protocol for treatment of plantar fasciitis should look for both hamstring as well as triceps surae tightness. Stretching exercise programs could be recommended for treatment of plantar fasciitis, focusing on stretching the triceps surae and hamstrings, apart from an adequate tissue-specific plantar fascia-stretching protocol.Level of Evidence:Level III, case control study.},

This was an open-label study. Patients. Patients comprised a group of eight women with secondary amenorrhea. Interventions. An oral preparation containing CC (50 mg/day) was administered for 5 days followed by a double dose (100 mg/day) for another 5 days, initiated on day 3 after estrogen/progestogen-induced withdrawal bleeding. If ovulation and vaginal bleeding occurred, treatment continued in the two next months with 100 mg/day from day 3 to day 7 day of the cycle. Main outcome measures. Cycle control was evaluated at each visit, when patients recorded bleeding patterns and tablet intake. Data on the intensity and duration of bleeding were collected. Results. Six patients responded to the first cycle of CC administration, resuming normal menstrual cycles. The other two patients failed to menstruate after the first 10 days of treatment with CC and repeated the same protocol. After the second administration, these two women also had normal menstrual bleeding. Conclusions. The present data show that this new protocol of CC treatment may be useful to restore normal menstrual cycles in young women with hypothalamic amenorrhea.},

Recent news stories have illustrated the widespread use of face masks for protection against Swine flu (H1N1), Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (SARS), Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) virus outbreaks in Asia, and dust from the collapse of the World Trade Center. However, the level of protection provided by face masks is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine how efficiently face masks prevent respiratory exposure to potentially harmful aerosols. Three types of commonly available face masks were tested: a surgical mask, a pre-shaped dust mask, and a bandana. An N95 respirator was tested as the positive control. Masks were fit onto a Styrofoam? mannequin head modified with a 5/8-inch diameter sample probe that was placed inside a 147.5 liter test plenum; a 5/8-inch diameter reference probe was positioned next to the mannequin head. Saline aerosols were generated in the test plenum using an IV HEART? (Westmed, Inc., Tucson, AZ) nebulizer. Each face mask was challenged for 30 minutes. Filter samples were collected simultaneously from the mannequin and reference sample probes and used to calculate aerosol concentrations. The mannequin sample probe and the reference sample probe volumetric flow rates were 8.75 L/min and 1.72 L/min, respectively. The mean challenge aerosol concentration, determined from the reference sample probe, was 0.045 {$\pm$} 0.008 mg/L with a mass median aerodynamic particle size of 1.6 ?m. Face mask protective efficiency was calculated as the ratio of mannequin sample probe concentration to reference sample probe concentration. The protective efficiencies were 33.3\%, 11.3\%, and 6.1\% for the surgical, bandana, and dust masks, respectively. The N95 mask protective efficiency was 89.6\%. In conclusion, the surgical mask protected the best of the three face masks tested. However, it is important to note that all three masks offer very little protection when compared to the N95, and wearing these face masks may produce a false sense of protection.},

  abstract = {Enveloped viruses need to fuse with a host cell membrane in order to deliver their genome into the host cell. While some viruses fuse with the plasma membrane, many viruses are endocytosed prior to fusion. Specific cues in the endosomal microenvironment induce conformational changes in the viral fusion proteins leading to viral and host membrane fusion. In the present study we investigated the entry of coronaviruses (CoVs). Using siRNA gene silencing, we found that proteins known to be important for late endosomal maturation and endosome-lysosome fusion profoundly promote infection of cells with mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV). Using recombinant MHVs expressing reporter genes as well as a novel, replication-independent fusion assay we confirmed the importance of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and demonstrated that trafficking of MHV to lysosomes is required for fusion and productive entry to occur. Nevertheless, MHV was shown to be less sensitive to perturbation of endosomal pH than vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza A virus, which fuse in early and late endosomes, respectively. Our results indicate that entry of MHV depends on proteolytic processing of its fusion protein S by lysosomal proteases. Fusion of MHV was severely inhibited by a pan-lysosomal protease inhibitor, while trafficking of MHV to lysosomes and processing by lysosomal proteases was no longer required when a furin cleavage site was introduced in the S protein immediately upstream of the fusion peptide. Also entry of feline CoV was shown to depend on trafficking to lysosomes and processing by lysosomal proteases. In contrast, MERS-CoV, which contains a minimal furin cleavage site just upstream of the fusion peptide, was negatively affected by inhibition of furin, but not of lysosomal proteases. We conclude that a proteolytic cleavage site in the CoV S protein directly upstream of the fusion peptide is an essential determinant of the intracellular site of fusion.},

Recent preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that chronic hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor for hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. It is probably also an independent risk factor for chronic kidney disease, Type 2 diabetes, and cognitive decline. These relationships have been observed for high serum UA levels ({$>$}5.5 mg/dL in women and {$>$}6 mg/dL in men), but also for normal to high serum UA levels (5\textendash 6 mg/dL). In this regard, blood UA levels are much higher in industrialized countries than in the rest of the world. Xanthine-oxidase inhibitors can reduce UA and seem to minimize its negative effects on vascular health. Other dietary and pathophysiological factors are also related to UA production. However, the role of fructose-derived UA in the pathogenesis of cardiometabolic disorders has not yet been fully clarified. Here, we critically review recent research on the biochemistry of UA production, the relationship between fructose intake and UA production, and how this relationship is linked to cardiometabolic disorders.},

  abstract = {Axillary malodour is a frustrating condition for many people. It can lead to significant discomforts and various psychological effects. The underarm microbiome plays a major role in axillary malodour formation. Not only the bacteria on the epidermis, but also and especially those living in the sweat glands, sweat pores and hair follicles play a pivotal role in malodour development. To treat underarm malodour, this viewpoint article envisions a bacterial treatment. Replacing the autochthonous malodour-causing microbiome with a non-odour-causing microbiome, through an armpit bacterial transplantation or direct application of probiotics/non-odour-causing bacteria, could resolve the condition. Selective steering of the microbiome with prebiotics, biochemicals or plant extracts can likewise greatly help in improving the underarm odour. Elimination/inhibition of the ``bad bugs'' and application/stimulation of the ``good bugs'' will be part of the future treatment for axillary body odour.},

  abstract = {Diabetes and obesity are two metabolic diseases characterized by insulin resistance and a low-grade inflammation. Seeking an inflammatory factor causative of the onset of insulin resistance, obesity, and diabetes, we have identified bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a triggering factor. We found that normal endotoxemia increased or decreased during the fed or fasted state, respectively, on a nutritional basis and that a 4-week high-fat diet chronically increased plasma LPS concentration two to three times, a threshold that we have defined as metabolic endotoxemia. Importantly, a high-fat diet increased the proportion of an LPS-containing microbiota in the gut. When metabolic endotoxemia was induced for 4 weeks in mice through continuous subcutaneous infusion of LPS, fasted glycemia and insulinemia and whole-body, liver, and adipose tissue weight gain were increased to a similar extent as in high-fat-fed mice. In addition, adipose tissue F4/80-positive cells and markers of inflammation, and liver triglyceride content, were increased. Furthermore, liver, but not whole-body, insulin resistance was detected in LPS-infused mice. CD14 mutant mice resisted most of the LPS and high-fat diet-induced features of metabolic diseases. This new finding demonstrates that metabolic endotoxemia dysregulates the inflammatory tone and triggers body weight gain and diabetes. We conclude that the LPS/CD14 system sets the tone of insulin sensitivity and the onset of diabetes and obesity. Lowering plasma LPS concentration could be a potent strategy for the control of metabolic diseases.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Anaphylaxis is the most severe and frightening of the allergic reactions, placing patients at high risk and demanding prompt recognition and immediate management by health care providers. Yet because its symptoms imitate those of other diseases, such as asthma and urticaria, current data suggest that its diagnosis is often missed, with underuse of tryptase measurement; its treatment is delayed, with little use of epinephrine; and its underlying cause or causes are poorly investigated. Deaths from anaphylaxis are difficult to investigate because of miscoding. Surprisingly, patients treated with new and powerful chemotherapy agents and humanized mAbs present with nonclassical symptoms of anaphylaxis, and patients may present with unrecognized clonal mast cell disorders with \emph{KIT} mutations may present as Hymenoptera-induced or idiopathic anaphylaxis. The goal of this review is to recognize the presentations of anaphylaxis with the description of its current phenotypes, to provide new insight and understanding of its mechanisms and causes through its endotypes, and to address its biomarkers for broad clinical use. Ultimately, the aim is to empower allergists and heath care providers with new tools that can help alleviate patients' symptoms, preventing and protecting them against anaphylaxis.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Calcifediol can rapidly increase serum 25OHD concentration. We therefore evaluated the effect of calcifediol treatment, on Intensive Care Unit Admission and Mortality rate among Spanish patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Design parallel pilot randomized open label, double-masked clinical trial. Setting university hospital setting (Reina Sofia University Hospital, C\'ordoba Spain.) Participants 76 consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection, clinical picture of acute respiratory infection, confirmed by a radiographic pattern of viral pneumonia and by a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR with CURB65 severity scale (recommending hospital admission in case of total score {$>$} 1). Procedures All hospitalized patients received as best available therapy the same standard care, (per hospital protocol), of a combination of hydroxychloroquine (400\,mg every 12\,hours on the first day, and 200\,mg every 12\,hours for the following 5 days), azithromycin (500\,mg orally for 5 days. Eligible patients were allocated at a 2 calcifediol:1 no calcifediol ratio through electronic randomization on the day of admission to take oral calcifediol (0.532\,mg), or not. Patients in the calcifediol treatment group continued with oral calcifediol (0.266\,mg) on day 3 and 7, and then weekly until discharge or ICU admission. Outcomes of effectiveness included rate of ICU admission and deaths. Results Of 50 patients treated with calcifediol, one required admission to the ICU (2\%), while of 26 untreated patients, 13 required admission (50\%) p value X2 Fischer test p\,{$<$}\,0.001. Univariate Risk Estimate Odds Ratio for ICU in patients with Calcifediol treatment versus without Calcifediol treatment: 0.02 (95\%CI 0.002-0.17). Multivariate Risk Estimate Odds Ratio for ICU in patients with Calcifediol treatment vs Without Calcifediol treatment ICU (adjusting by Hypertension and T2DM): 0.03 (95\%CI: 0.003-0.25). Of the patients treated with calcifediol, none died, and all were discharged, without complications. The 13 patients not treated with calcifediol, who were not admitted to the ICU, were discharged. Of the 13 patients admitted to the ICU, two died and the remaining 11 were discharged. Conclusion Our pilot study demonstrated that administration of a high dose of Calcifediol or 25-hydroxyvitamin D, a main metabolite of vitamin D endocrine system, significantly reduced the need for ICU treatment of patients requiring hospitalization due to proven COVID-19. Calcifediol seems to be able to reduce severity of the disease, but larger trials with groups properly matched will be required to show a definitive answer.},

  abstract = {Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been largely used and investigated as therapy for COVID-19 across various settings at a total dose usually ranging from 2400 mg to 9600 mg. In Belgium, off-label use of low-dose HCQ (total 2400 mg over 5 days) was recommended for hospitalised patients with COVID-19. We conducted a retrospective analysis of in-hospital mortality in the Belgian national COVID-19 hospital surveillance data. Patients treated either with HCQ monotherapy and supportive care (HCQ group) were compared with patients treated with supportive care only (no-HCQ group) using a competing risks proportional hazards regression with discharge alive as competing risk, adjusted for demographic and clinical features with robust standard errors. Of 8075 patients with complete discharge data on 24 May 2020 and diagnosed before 1 May 2020, 4542 received HCQ in monotherapy and 3533 were in the no-HCQ group. Death was reported in 804/4542 (17.7\%) and 957/3533 (27.1\%), respectively. In the multivariable analysis, mortality was lower in the HCQ group compared with the no-HCQ group [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR)~=~0.684, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.617\textendash 0.758]. Compared with the no-HCQ group, mortality in the HCQ group was reduced both in patients diagnosed {$\leq$}5 days (n~=~3975) and {$>$}5 days (n~=~3487) after symptom onset [aHR~=~0.701 (95\% CI 0.617\textendash 0.796) and aHR~=~0.647 (95\% CI 0.525\textendash 0.797), respectively]. Compared with supportive care only, low-dose HCQ monotherapy was independently associated with lower mortality in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 diagnosed and treated early or later after symptom onset.},

Although a poor prognosis has been mentioned in previously reported patients, the precise pathomechanism and clinical significance are still unknown. Patients and methods: We report four patients with ocular salt-and-pepper pain, and review the clinical course, neuroimaging and prognosis in another eight patients reported in the literature. Results: In our series, they were three men and one woman, and their underlying cause was pontine hemorrhage; hypertensive hemorrhage in three and cavernous hemangioma in one patient, respectively. In these 12 salt-and-pepper patients, the identifiable etiology was exclusively brainstem stroke. Lifethreatening or disable neurological deterioration ensued within 24 h after pain onset in all patients. Their ocular pain subsided rapidly after neurological deterioration occurred. A dual excitation of nociceptive quinothalamic pain fiber and disinhibition of trigeminosensory system from pontine reticular formation and cerulotrigeminospinal circuit may be responsible for this pain. Conclusion: In clinical practice, ocular salt-and-pepper pain in quiet eyes should be alerted for intracranial pathology and neurological deterioration until underlying cause is identified. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, there are only limited therapy choices and no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is currently available. Here we report about a case of a SARS-CoV-2 caused pneumonia successfully treated with thalidomide. Thalidomide is an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory agent and was combined with a low-dose glucocorticoid. We suggest, that the effects of thalidomide might be related to regulating immunity, inhibiting the inflammatory cytokine surge, alleviating anxiety to reduce oxygen consumption, relieving vomit and lung exudation.},

  abstract = {Phytosterols (PSs) are a group of plant derived steroid alcohols, with wide occurrence in vegetables and fruits. They are integral components of plant cell membranes, having stabilizing effects on phospholipids bilayer, just like cholesterol in animal cell membranes. Structural resemblance of PSs with cholesterol enables them to displace low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the human intestine. Protective effects of PSs against cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), colon and breast cancer developments have been widely documented. Several reports have been published on the potential dietary intake of common PSs, such as {$\beta$}-sitosterol, stigmasterol and campesterol, and their safety concerns. Ability of PSs to reduce cholesterol levels and risks associated with heart problems has made them a class of favorite food supplements. Nowadays functional foods supplemented with PSs have become an alternative and healthy tool to lower LDL-cholesterol levels in a natural way. However, excessive use of PSs has been observed to develop premature coronary artery disease in phytosterolemic patients, high risk of atherosclerotic CVDs, myocardial infarction and even impaired endothelial functions. This manuscript will highlight the recent developments in PSs with particular focus on their role as dietary supplements and in treatment of various heart- and cholesterol-related ailments. Recently explored side effects of PSs will also be discussed.},

Typical symptoms include flushing, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, hypotension, and collapse during or after exercise. The far best described entity within EIA is food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA), where symptoms only occur in combination with food intake. Frequency and predictability of symptoms vary, and some patients experience symptoms only if exercise is accompanied by other co-factorsAreas covered: In the present review, we aimed to provide an overview of EIA, diagnostic workup, causes, management and discuss areas in need of further research.Expert opinion: Though rare, EIA is an entity that all allergists and practicing physicians should recognize. The pathophysiological and immunological mechanisms of EIA are largely unknown. Management is centered upon avoidance of eliciting factors, where emergency plans are individualized, except a mandatory prescription of an adrenaline auto-injector.},

In this study, we investigated the risks of gallstone occurrence during a 5-year follow-up period after an appendectomy, using a population-based dataset. We used data from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005. The exposed cohort included 4916 patients who underwent an appendectomy. The unexposed cohort was retrieved by randomly selecting 4916 patients matched with the exposed cohort in terms of sex, age, and year. We individually tracked each patient for a 5-year period to identify those who received a diagnosis of gallstones during the follow-up period. Cox proportional hazard regressions were performed for the analysis. During the 5-year follow-up period, the incidence rate per 1000 person-years was 4.71 for patients who had undergone an appendectomy, compared to a rate of 2.59 for patients in the unexposed cohort (p{$<$}0.001). Patients who had undergone an appendectomy were independently associated with a 1.79 (95\% CI = 1.29\textasciitilde 2.48)-fold increased risk of being diagnosed with gallstones during the 5-year follow-up period. We found that among female patients, the adjusted hazard ratio of gallstones was 2.25 (95\% CI = 1.41\textasciitilde 3.59) for patients who underwent an appendectomy compared to unexposed patients. However, for male patients, we failed to observe an increased hazard for gallstones among patients who underwent an appendectomy compared to unexposed patients. We found an increased risk of a subsequent gallstone diagnosis within 5 years after an appendectomy.},

Given that causes of dysphagia differ from patient to patient, individualized treatment plans tailored toward patients' specific conditions are needed. Here we present a case of an elderly woman with upper neck stiffness and dysphagia sought chiropractic treatment. Radiographic findings suggested cervical spondylosis with a vertical atlantoaxial subluxation. Following 20 sessions of chiropractic treatment, the patient experienced complete relief from neck problems and difficulty in swallowing. Rhythmic swallowing movements are controlled by a central pattern-generating circuit of the brain stem. In this case, the brain stem could have been compressed by the odontoid process of the axis due to C1/2 instability. Cervicogenic dysphagia is a cervical cause of difficulty in swallowing. Cervical complaints in the context of dysphagia are mostly under-estimated. A high degree of clinical suspicion is pivotal in timely intervention.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of altering from habitual mixed Western-based (HD) to a very low-carbohydrate high-fat (VLCHF) diet over a 4-week timecourse on performance and physiological responses during high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Eighteen moderately trained males (age 23.8 {$\pm$} 2.1 years) consuming their HD (48 {$\pm$} 13\% carbohydrate, 17 {$\pm$} 3\% protein, 35 {$\pm$} 9\% fat) were assigned to 2 groups. One group was asked to remain on their HD, while the other was asked to switch to a non-standardized VLCHF diet (8 {$\pm$} 3\% carbohydrate, 29 {$\pm$} 15\% protein, 63 {$\pm$} 13\% fat) for 4 weeks. Participants performed graded exercise tests (GXT) before and after the experiment, and an HIIT session (5x3min, work/rest 2:1, passive recovery, total time 34min) before, and after 2 and 4 weeks. Heart rate (HR), oxygen uptake ({\.V}O2), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), maximal fat oxidation rates (Fatmax) and blood lactate were measured. Total time to exhaustion (TTE) and maximal {\.V}O2 ({\.V}O2max) in the GXT increased in both groups, but between-group changes were trivial (ES {$\pm$} 90\% CI: -0.1 {$\pm$} 0.3) and small (0.57 {$\pm$} 0.5), respectively. Between-group difference in Fatmax change (VLCHF: 0.8 {$\pm$} 0.3 to 1.1 {$\pm$} 0.2 g/min; HD: 0.7 {$\pm$} 0.2 to 0.8 {$\pm$} 0.2 g/min) was large (1.2{$\pm$}0.9), revealing greater increases in the VLCHF versus HD group. Between-group comparisons of mean changes in {\.V}O2 and HR during the HIIT sessions were trivial to small, whereas mean RER decreased more in the VLCHF group (-1.5 {$\pm$} 0.1). Lactate changes between groups were unclear. Adoption of a VLCHF diet over 4 weeks increased Fatmax and did not adversely affect TTE during the GXT or cardiorespiratory responses to HIIT compared with the HD.,                                        Key points                                                          A group of participants that changed from habitual mixed western-based to VLCHF diet over 4 weeks substantially increased rates of fat oxidation shown during a graded exercise test and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) session.

We monitored various parameters: Oxidative Stress (D-Rom and Bap test), Psychological Responses (test POMS and Measure of Global Stress), Metabolic expenditure (kJ) using a metabolic holter, EEG records, Cortisol, and Catecholamines level. Results: An interesting result was observed in the post-test phase, when a brief moment of deep sleep and total absence of a very deep sleep occurred, while an almost normal condition occurred in the pre-test sleep. Conclusion: During the 72-h sleep deprivation, no psycho-physiological stress was recorded. The participant has remained within the threshold of well-being. Only a peak was recorded during the 66th hour, but it was within the wellness threshold.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antibiotic therapy has been proposed as an alternative to surgery for the treatment of appendicitis. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, nonblinded, noninferiority, randomized trial comparing antibiotic therapy (10-day course) with appendectomy in patients with appendicitis at 25 U.S. centers. The primary outcome was 30-day health status, as assessed with the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire (scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating better health status; noninferiority margin, 0.05 points). Secondary outcomes included appendectomy in the antibiotics group and complications through 90 days; analyses were prespecified in subgroups defined according to the presence or absence of an appendicolith. RESULTS: In total, 1552 adults (414 with an appendicolith) underwent randomization; 776 were assigned to receive antibiotics (47\% of whom were not hospitalized for the index treatment) and 776 to undergo appendectomy (96\% of whom underwent a laparoscopic procedure). Antibiotics were noninferior to appendectomy on the basis of 30-day EQ-5D scores (mean difference, 0.01 points; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -0.001 to 0.03). In the antibiotics group, 29\% had undergone appendectomy by 90 days, including 41\% of those with an appendicolith and 25\% of those without an appendicolith. Complications were more common in the antibiotics group than in the appendectomy group (8.1 vs. 3.5 per 100 participants; rate ratio, 2.28; 95\% CI, 1.30 to 3.98); the higher rate in the antibiotics group could be attributed to those with an appendicolith (20.2 vs. 3.6 per 100 participants; rate ratio, 5.69; 95\% CI, 2.11 to 15.38) and not to those without an appendicolith (3.7 vs. 3.5 per 100 participants; rate ratio, 1.05; 95\% CI, 0.45 to 2.43). The rate of serious adverse events was 4.0 per 100 participants in the antibiotics group and 3.0 per 100 participants in the appendectomy group (rate ratio, 1.29; 95\% CI, 0.67 to 2.50). CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of appendicitis, antibiotics were noninferior to appendectomy on the basis of results of a standard health-status measure. In the antibiotics group, nearly 3 in 10 participants had undergone appendectomy by 90 days. Participants with an appendicolith were at a higher risk for appendectomy and for complications than those without an appendicolith.

  abstract = {Background A low plasma level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), but the effect of lifelong reductions in plasma LDL cholesterol is not known. We examined the effect of DNA-sequence variations that reduce plasma levels of LDL cholesterol on the incidence of coronary events in a large population. Methods We compared the incidence of CHD (myocardial infarction, fatal CHD, or coronary revascularization) over a 15-year interval in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study according to the presence or absence of sequence variants in the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 serine protease gene (PCSK9) that are associated with reduced plasma levels of LDL cholesterol. Results Of the 3363 black subjects examined, 2.6 percent had nonsense mutations in PCSK9; these mutations were associated with a 28 percent reduction in mean LDL cholesterol and an 88 percent reduction in the risk of CHD (P = 0.008 for the reduction; hazard ratio, 0.11; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.81; P = 0.03). Of the 9524 white subjects examined, 3.2 percent had a sequence variation in PCSK9 that was associated with a 15 percent reduction in LDL cholesterol and a 47 percent reduction in the risk of CHD (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.79; P = 0.003).

  abstract = {Purpose To assess efficacy and safety of chloroquine (CQ)/hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for treatment or prophylaxis of COVID-19 in adult humans. Materials and methods MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE and two pre-print repositories (bioRxiv, medRxiv) were searched from inception to 8th June 2020 for RCTs and nonrandomized studies (retrospective and prospective, including single-arm, studies) addressing the use of CQ/HCQ in any dose or combination for COVID-19. Results Thirty-two studies were included (6 RCTs, 26 nonrandomized, 29,192 participants). Two RCTs had high risk, two `some concerns' and two low risk of bias (Rob2). Among nonrandomized studies with comparators, nine had high risk and five moderate risk of bias (ROBINS-I). Data synthesis was not possible. Low and moderate risk of bias studies suggest that treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 with CQ/HCQ may not reduce risk of death, compared to standard care. High dose regimens or combination with macrolides may be associated with harm. Postexposure prophylaxis may not reduce the rate of infection but the quality of the evidence is low. Conclusions Patients with COVID-19 should be treated with CQ/HCQ only if monitored and within the context of high quality RCTs. High quality data about efficacy/safety are urgently needed.},

  abstract = {The effects of varying high intensity interval training (HIIT) and sprint interval training (SIT) frequency on 1.5 mile (2.4km) run performance in Air Force ROTC cadets were studied. Twenty-seven cadets (21.6 {$\pm$} 2.8 years) were stratified then randomly assigned to 3 groups: a high frequency group (HF) that performed HIIT/SIT 3x week, a low frequency group (LF) that performed HIIT/SIT 2x week, and a continuous training group (CG) that performed moderate intensity training 3x week. HIIT workouts consisted of 4 x 3 min intervals at 90-100\% of velocity at maximal oxygen consumption (vVO2 max) with 4 min of active recovery between sets. SIT workouts consisted of 4 x 30s all out sprints with 4 min active recovery between sets. Baseline 1.5 mile run performance was measured, then retested at 6 and 10 weeks. At the end of 6 weeks, all groups significantly improved in mean 1.5 mile run time (LF, 7.3\% + 4.2, p{$<$}0.001; HF, 9.7\% + 3.5, p{$<$}0.001; CG, 8.7\% + 4.8, p{$<$}0.001). No significant differences between groups were found at any point in time (p{$>$}0.05). Additional workouts beyond the 6-week point yielded no significant gains in run performance for any group. In conclusion, 2 days per week of combined HIIT/SIT training was as effective at improving 1.5 mile run performance as either 3 days/week of HIIT/SIT or continuous training, and the majority of initial performance gains from HIIT were achieved within the first 6 weeks of training.},

  abstract = {A cross-sectional study of the nutritional significance of food aversions and cravings during pregnancy was conducted on 295 women in southern Ethiopia between February and May 1995. A questionnaire was used to collect data on dietary practices. Mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC), triceps skinfold thickness (TSFT), and weight measurements were used to assess nutritional status. Slightly fewer than three-quarters (71\%) of the women craved one or more foods, whereas about two-thirds (65\%) avoided at least one food. Cereal foods, despite being staple foods in the area, were avoided by more women (41\%) than any other foods. Livestock products, which were scarce at the time of the study, were craved by more women (55\%) than any other foods. Comparisons using various anthropometric indicators revealed that women who avoided foods had significantly higher MUAC and TSFT than those who did not (p {$<$} .05), whereas there was no difference in nutritional status between women who craved foods and those who did not. However, those craving women who managed to get the desired foods had significantly higher weight gain (p {$<$} .05), but not significantly higher MUAC or TSFT, than those who did not. Aversion and craving were positively associated (?2 = 10.66, p {$<$} .001; odds ratio, 2.36). Thus, women who avoided foods were 2.4 times more likely to crave foods than those who did not avoid foods. This implies that aversion and craving are complementary processes geared towards ensuring optimal nutrition during pregnancy. Aversion results in the avoidance of monotonous diets, whereas craving calls for varied and nutritious foods. More research, however, is needed before such a conclusion is warranted.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Increasing numbers of parents use alternative vaccination schedules that differ from the recommended childhood vaccination schedule for their children. We sought to describe national patterns of alternative vaccination schedule use and the potential ``malleability'' of parents' current vaccination schedule choices. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional, Internet-based survey of a nationally representative sample of parents of children 6 months to 6 years of age. Bivariate and multivariate analyses determined associations between demographic and attitudinal factors and alternative vaccination schedule use. RESULTS: The response rate was 61\% (N ϭ 748). Of the 13\% of parents who reported following an alternative vaccination schedule, most refused only certain vaccines (53\%) and/or delayed some vaccines until the child was older (55\%). Only 17\% reported refusing all vaccines. In multivariate models, nonblack race and not having a regular health care provider for the child were the only factors significantly associated with higher odds of using an alternative schedule. A large proportion of alternative vaccinators (30\%) reported having initially followed the recommended vaccination schedule. Among parents following the recommended vaccination schedule, 28\% thought that delaying vaccine doses was safer than the schedule they used, and 22\% disagreed that the best vaccination schedule to follow was the one recommended by vaccination experts. CONCLUSIONS: More than 1 of 10 parents of young children currently use an alternative vaccination schedule. In addition, a large proportion of parents currently following the recommended schedule seem to be ``at risk'' for switching to an alternative schedule. Pediatrics 2011;128:848\textendash 856},

Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we included adults (age{$\geq$}18years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 without Invasive ventilation, diagnosed between Jan 17, 2020, and Feb 13, 2020. Patients, diagnosed after Jan 17, 2020, were given oral arbidol and LPV/r in the combination group and oral LPV/r only in the monotherapy group for 5\textendash 21 days. The primary endpoint was a negative conversion rate of coronavirus from the date of COVID-19 diagnosis(day7, day14), and assessed whether the pneumonia was progressing or improving by chest CT (day7). Results We analyzed 16 patients who received oral arbidol and LPV/r in the combination group and 17 who oral LPV/r only in the monotherapy group, and both initiated after diagnosis. Baseline clinical, laboratory, and chest CT characteristics were similar between groups. The SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected for 12(75\%) of 16 patients' nasopharyngeal specimens in the combination group after seven days, compared with 6 (35\%) of 17 in the monotherapy group (p {$<$} 0{$\cdot$}05).

Methods Electronic medical records of 11 patients with COVID-19 were collected and demographics, clinical manifestations, outcomes, key laboratory results, and radiological images are discussed. Results The clinical course of the eleven cases demonstrated the complexity of the COVID-19 profile with different clinical presentations. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic cases to patients with mild and severe symptoms, with or without pneumonia. Laboratory detection of the viral nucleic acid can yield false-negative results, and serological testing of virus specific IgG and IgM antibodies should be used as an alternative for diagnosis. Patients with common allergic diseases did not develop distinct symptoms and severe courses. Cases with a pre-existing condition of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or complicated with a secondary bacterial pneumonia were more severe.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The causal agent for SARS is considered as a novel coronavirus that has never been described both in human and animals previously. The stability of SARS coronavirus in human specimens and in environments was studied. METHODS: Using a SARS coronavirus strain CoV-P9, which was isolated from pharyngeal swab of a probable SARS case in Beijing, its stability in mimic human specimens and in mimic environment including surfaces of commonly used materials or in household conditions, as well as its resistance to temperature and UV irradiation were analyzed. A total of 10(6) TCID50 viruses were placed in each tested condition, and changes of the viral infectivity in samples after treatments were measured by evaluating cytopathic effect (CPE) in cell line Vero-E6 at 48 h after infection. RESULTS: The results showed that SARS coronavirus in the testing condition could survive in serum, 1:20 diluted sputum and feces for at least 96 h, whereas it could remain alive in urine for at least 72 h with a low level of infectivity. The survival abilities on the surfaces of eight different materials and in water were quite comparable, revealing reduction of infectivity after 72 to 96 h exposure. Viruses stayed stable at 4 degrees C, at room temperature (20 degrees C) and at 37 degrees C for at least 2 h without remarkable change in the infectious ability in cells, but were converted to be non-infectious after 90-, 60- and 30-min exposure at 56 degrees C, at 67 degrees C and at 75 degrees C, respectively. Irradiation of UV for 60 min on the virus in culture medium resulted in the destruction of viral infectivity at an undetectable level. CONCLUSION: The survival ability of SARS coronavirus in human specimens and in environments seems to be relatively strong. Heating and UV irradiation can efficiently eliminate the viral infectivity.},

Methods: This randomized, open-label study was performed in 40 healthy female volunteers, who were randomized by a computer-generated list after stratification for the ovulation day in a pretreatment cycle. They received two cycles of NuvaRing (21 subjects) or a COC (30 {$\mu$}g ethinylestradiol and 150 {$\mu$}g levonorgestrel, 19 subjects). NuvaRing was started on cycle day 5, COC on cycle day 1. Follicular diameter, endometrial thickness and FSH, LH, 17{$\beta$}-estradiol (E2) and progesterone concentrations were determined. Results: The median maximum follicular diameter (maxFD) was {$\leq$}11 mm during treatment. In the first treatment cycle the maxFD was lower in the COC than in the NuvaRing group, due to the different starting procedures. MaxFD were not different in the second treatment cycle. In both groups, E2 and progesterone levels remained low during treatment. Ovulations did not occur. Conclusions: In both groups, ovarian activity was adequately suppressed. Due to the different starting procedures, lower ovarian activity was observed in the COC group in the first treatment cycle. In the second cycle, ovarian suppression was comparable with NuvaRing and COC treatment. \textcopyright{} European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology 2004; all rights reserved.},

More recently we have identified additional promising antiviral activities against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Chikungunya, Ebola and Marburg which highlights that this old drug may have other uses against new viruses. This may in turn inform the types of drugs that we need for virus outbreaks such as for the new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

  abstract = {Background Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is currently being examined for COVID-19. No previous meta-analysis has evaluated its side effects versus placebo. We conducted this meta-analysis to compare the safety of HCQ versus placebo. Methods Two authors independently searched PubMed and EMBASE databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adults comparing the adverse events (AEs) of HCQ versus placebo for any indication. Peto odds ratios (Peto ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated based on random-effects models. The heterogeneity (I2) was assessed using Cochran's Q test. Results Nine RCTs (eight were double-blind) with a total of 916 patients were included. HCQ caused significantly more skin pigmentation than placebo (Peto OR, 4.64; 95\% CI, 1.13 to 19.00; P-value~=~0.033; I2~=~0\%). The increase in other AEs did not reach statistical significance: rash (Peto OR, 1.11; 95\% CI, 0.3 to 3.77; P-value~=~0.03; I2~=~0\%); gastrointestinal AEs (Peto OR, 1.43; 95\% CI, 0.55 to 3.72; P-value~=~0.46; I2~=~15.17\%); headache (Peto OR, 1.94; 95\% CI, 0.65 to 5.78; P-value~=~0.23; I2~=~9.99\%); dizziness (Peto OR, 1.32; 95\% CI, 0.49 to 3.52; P-value~=~0.58; I2~=~0\%); fatigue (Peto OR, 2.13; 95\% CI, 0.76 to 5.98; P-value~=~0.15; I2~=~0\%); and visual AEs (Peto OR, 1.61; 95\% CI, 0.76 to 3.41; P-value~=~0.22; I2~=~0\%). Cardiac toxicity was not reported. Conclusions This meta-analysis of RCTs found a significantly higher risk of skin pigmentation in HCQ users versus placebo.

Chronic pruritus is sometimes accompanied by pain, paresthesias, or altered sensation to touch. Objectives: To review the current literature with regards to the cause of NP and its most appropriate treatment. Methods: Comprehensive literature review using PubMed to inspect the available data on NP. Results: The most likely cause of NP is cutaneous nerve damage. Many therapies have been tried in the treatment of NP, mostly in small case studies. Conclusions: The published cases and studies suggest symptoms of NP are due to a cutaneous sensory neuropathy. Treatments addressing the condition as such are more successful than traditional itch therapies. In many cases, a simple explanation for the persistent pruritus is satisfactory for patients. For very distressing cases, therapy should address the condition as a benign sensory neuropathy. Further studies are needed to evaluate which treatments have the greatest potential for providing symptom relief.},

  abstract = {Background: No targeted immunotherapies reverse type 1 diabetes in humans. However, in a rodent model of type 1 diabetes, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) reverses disease by restoring insulin secretion. Specifically, it stimulates innate immunity by inducing the host to produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which, in turn, kills disease-causing autoimmune cells and restores pancreatic beta-cell function through regeneration. Methodology/Principal Findings: Translating these findings to humans, we administered BCG, a generic vaccine, in a proofof-principle, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adults with long-term type 1 diabetes (mean: 15.3 years) at one clinical center in North America. Six subjects were randomly assigned to BCG or placebo and compared to self, healthy paired controls (n = 6) or reference subjects with (n = 57) or without (n = 16) type 1 diabetes, depending upon the outcome measure. We monitored weekly blood samples for 20 weeks for insulin-autoreactive T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and other autoantibodies, and C-peptide, a marker of insulin secretion. BCG-treated patients and one placebo-treated patient who, after enrollment, unexpectedly developed acute Epstein-Barr virus infection, a known TNF inducer, exclusively showed increases in dead insulin-autoreactive T cells and induction of Tregs. C-peptide levels (pmol/L) significantly rose transiently in two BCG-treated subjects (means: 3.49 pmol/L [95\% CI 2.95\textendash 3.8], 2.57 [95\% CI 1.65\textendash 3.49]) and the EBV-infected subject (3.16 [95\% CI 2.54\textendash 3.69]) vs.1.65 [95\% CI 1.55\textendash 3.2] in reference diabetic subjects. BCG-treated subjects each had more than 50\% of their C-peptide values above the 95th percentile of the reference subjects. The EBV-infected subject had 18\% of C-peptide values above this level. Conclusions/Significance: We conclude that BCG treatment or EBV infection transiently modified the autoimmunity that underlies type 1 diabetes by stimulating the host innate immune response. This suggests that BCG or other stimulators of host innate immunity may have value in the treatment of long-term diabetes.},

It will be difficult and costly to develop new drugs that target each of these viruses. Statins and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been effective in treating patients with sepsis, pneumonia and influenza, and a statin/ARB combination appeared to dramatically reduce mortality during the recent Ebola outbreak. These drugs target (among other things) the endothelial dysfunction found in all of these diseases. Most scientists work on new drugs that target viruses, and few accept the idea of treating the host response with generic drugs. A great deal of research will be needed to show conclusively that these drugs work, and this will require the support of public agencies and foundations. Investigators in developing countries should take an active role in this research. If the next Public Health Emergency of International Concern is caused by an emerging virus, a ``top down'' approach to developing specific new drug treatments is unlikely to be effective. However, a ``bottom up'' approach to treatment that targets the host response to these viruses by using widely available and inexpensive generic drugs could reduce mortality in any country with a basic health care system. In doing so, it would make an immeasurable contribution to global equity and global security.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of dietary caffeine intake and withdrawal on cerebral blood flow (CBF), as determined from a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty adults (16 men, four women; age range, 24-64 years) categorized as low (mean, 41 mg/d) or high (mean, 648 mg/d) caffeine users underwent quantitative flow-sensitive alternating inversion-recovery perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging twice: 90 minutes after a dose of caffeine (250 mg) on one day and after a dose of placebo on another day (randomized counterbalanced design). Doses were preceded by 30 hours of caffeine abstinence to induce withdrawal in high caffeine users. Quantitative CBF maps were gray matter (GM)\textendash white matter (WM) segmented and subjected to region-of-interest analysis to obtain mean CBF in WM, anterior circulation GM (AGM), and posterior circulation GM (PGM). By using two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance, regional CBF data were tested for within-subject differences between caffeine and placebo and for between-subject differences related to dietary caffeine habits. Linear regression was used to determine whether dietary caffeine use predicts CBF or CBF response to caffeine.RESULTS: Caffeine reduced CBF (P {$\leq$} .05) by 23\% (AGM, PGM) and 18\% (WM) in all subjects. Postplacebo (withdrawal) CBF in high caffeine users exceeded that in low users (P {$\leq$} .05) by 31\% (AGM) and 32\% (WM) (PGM, not significant). Mean postcaffeine CBF reduction in AGM was 26\% in high users versus 19\% in low users (P {$\leq$} .05; PGM and WM, not significant). Increasing caffeine consumption predicted higher CBF (P {$\leq$} .05) in all regions: r = 0.79 (AGM), 0.57 (PGM), and 0.76 (WM). Dietary caffeine use did not predict CBF response to caffeine.CONCLUSION: Dietary caffeine consumption and withdrawal are potential confounding variables in cerebral perfusion and functional MR imaging.\textcopyright{} RSNA, 2003},

Pain in a quiet eye can be the first sign of a vision-threatening condition, a more benign ophthalmologic condition, or a nonophthalmologic condition. Acute narrow-angle glaucoma is an emergent vision-threatening condition that requires immediate treatment and referral to an ophthalmologist. Although most nonophthalmologic conditions that cause eye pain do not need immediate treatment, giant cell (temporal) arteritis requires urgent treatment with corticosteroids. Other vascular conditions, such as carotid artery disease, thrombosis of the cavernous sinus, and transient ischemic attack or stroke, rarely cause eye pain but must be considered. Pain may also be referred from the sinuses or from neurologic conditions, such as trigeminal neuralgia, migraine and cluster headaches, and increased intracranial pressure.

It has been suggested that a Western diet may contribute to the prevalence and manifestation of allergies and asthma through reduced intake of dietary fiber and the subsequent production of their metabolites. Indeed, dietary fiber and its metabolites have been shown to positively influence the development of immune disorders via changes in microbiota composition and the regulation of B- and T-cell activation. However, the effects of these dietary components on the activation of mast cells, key effector cells of the inflammatory response in allergies and asthma, remain poorly characterized. Due to their location in the gut and vascularized tissues, mast cells are exposed to high concentrations of dietary fiber and/or its metabolites. Here, we provide a focused overview of current findings regarding the direct effects of dietary fiber and its various metabolites on the regulation of mast cell activity and the pathophysiology of mast cell-associated diseases.},

The relationship holds even for mild degrees of hyperlipidaemia, a fact that underlines the importance of this category of disorders. Both primary and secondary hyperlipidaemias represent such a variety of abnormalities that an internationally acceptable provisional classification is highly desirable in order to facilitate communication between scientists with different backgrounds., The present memorandum presents such a classification; it briefly describes the criteria for diagnosis of the main types of hyperlipidaemia as well as the methods of their determination. Because lipoproteins offer more information than analysis of plasma lipids (most of the plasma lipids being bound to various proteins), the classification is based on lipoprotein analyses by electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation. Simpler methods, however, such as the observation of plasma and measurements of cholesterol and triglycerides, are used to the fullest possible extent in determining the lipoprotein patterns.},

Serum hormones were compared within and between two groups of healthy young male volunteers participating in the 8-wk US Army Ranger course, with four repeated cycles of restricted energy intakes and refeeding:group 1 (n = 49) and group 2 (n = 48); energy deficits averaged 1,200 and 1,000 kcal/day, respectively. After 8 wk, most of group 1 achieved a minimum body fat, serum 3,5,3{${'}$}-triiodothyronine (T3) was below normal (78 {$\pm$} 20 ng/dl), testosterone (T) approached castrate levels (4.5 {$\pm$} 3.9 nmol/l), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) declined by one-half (75 {$\pm$} 25 {$\mu$}g/l), and cholesterol rose from 158 {$\pm$} 31 to 217 {$\pm$} 39 mg/dl. Bioavailable T3 and T were further reduced by increases in their specific binding proteins in response to declining insulin. Refeeding, even with continuation of the other stressors, produced prompt recovery of T3, T, and IGF-I. Higher energy intakes in group 2 attenuated the subclinical hypothyroidism and hypercholesterolemia, whereas consistent luteinizing hormone suppression indicated centrally mediated threshold effects on gonadal hormone suppression. We conclude that low T, T3, and IGF-I remained reliable markers of acute energy deficits in the presence of other stressors; elevated cholesterol and cortisol provided information about chronic status, corresponding to diminishing body fat stores.},

Methods We included 1,387 men without hypertension, and Body Mass Index {$<$}30 kg/m2 in the Health Professional Follow-up Study. Dietary intake was assessed with a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire validated for use in this population. Serum uric acid concentrations were measured. Results Greater intakes of total vitamin C were significantly associated with lower serum uric acid concentrations, after adjustment for smoking, BMI, ethnicity, blood pressure, presence of gout, use of aspirin, and intake of energy, alcohol, dairy protein, fructose, meat, seafood, and coffee. An inverse dose-response association was observed through vitamin C intake of 400\textendash 500 mg/d, and then reached a plateau. Adjusted mean uric acid concentrations across total vitamin C intake categories ({$<$}90, 90\textendash 249, 250\textendash 499, 500\textendash 999, or {$\geq$} 1000 mg/d) were 6.4, 6.1, 6.0, 5.7, and 5.7 mg/dl, respectively (P for trend{$<$}0.001). Greater vitamin C intake was associated with lower prevalence of hyperuricemia (serum uric acid {$>$} 6 mg/dl). The multivariate ORs for hyperuricemia across total vitamin C intake categories were 1 (reference), 0.58, 0.57, 0.38, and 0.34 (95\% CI: 0.20\textendash 0.58; P-trend{$<$} 0.001). When we used dietary data, which were assessed 4\textendash 8 years before blood collection, as predictors, we observed similar inverse associations between vitamin C intake and uric acid. Conclusions These population-based data indicate that vitamin C intake is inversely associated with serum uric acid concentrations. These findings support a potential role of vitamin C in the prevention of hyperuricemia and gout.},

  abstract = {Background and Objectives In the United States, approximately 60 million Americans suffer from sleep disorders and about 22 million Americans report substance dependence or use disorders annually. Sleep disturbances are common consequences of substance use disorders and are likely found in primary care as well as in specialty practices. The aim of this review was to evaluate the effects of the most frequently used substances\textemdash nicotine, alcohol, opioids, cocaine, caffeine, and cannabis\textemdash have on sleep parameters measured by polysomnography (PSG) and related clinical manifestations. Methods We used electronic databases such as PubMED and PsycINFO to search for relevant articles. We only included studies that assessed sleep disturbances using polysomnography and reviewed the effects of these substances on six clinically relevant sleep parameters: Total sleep time, sleep onset latency, rapid-eye movement, REM latency, wake after sleep onset, and slow wave sleep. Results Our review indicates that these substances have significant impact on sleep and that their effects differ during intoxication, withdrawal, and chronic use. Many of the substance-induced sleep disturbances overlap with those encountered in sleep disorders, medical, and psychiatric conditions. Sleep difficulties also increase the likelihood of substance use disorder relapse, further emphasizing the need for optimizing treatment interventions in these patients. Conclusion and Scientific Significance Our review highlights the importance of systematically screening for substance use in patients with sleep disturbances and highlights the need for further research to understand mechanisms underlying substances-induced sleep disturbances and on effective interventions addressing these conditions.

  abstract = {Hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) is a secondary amenorrhea with no evidence of endocrine/systemic causal factors, mainly related to various stressors affecting neuroendocrine control of the reproductive axis. In clinical practice, HA is mainly associated with metabolic, physical, or psychological stress. Stress is the adaptive response of our body through all its homeostatic systems, to external and/or internal stimuli that activate specific and nonspecific physiological pathways. HA occurs generally after severe stressant conditions/situations such as dieting, heavy training, or intense emotional events, all situations that can induce amenorrhea with or without body weight loss and HA is a secondary amenorrhea with a diagnosis of exclusion. In fact, the diagnosis is essentially based on a good anamnestic investigation. It has to be investigated using the clinical history of the patient: occurrence of menarche, menstrual cyclicity, time and modality of amenorrhea, and it has to be exclude any endocrine disease or any metabolic (i.e., diabetes) and systemic disorders. It is necessary to identify any stressant situation induced by loss, family or working problems, weight loss or eating disorders, or physical training or agonist activity. Peculiar, though not specific, endocrine investigations might be proposed but no absolute parameter can be proposed since HA is greatly dependent from individual response to stressors and/or the adaptive response to stress. This article tries to give insights into diagnosis and putative therapeutic strategies. \textcopyright{} 2006 New York Academy of Sciences.},

  abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the influence of estriol administration on the hypothalamus-pituitary function and gonadotropins secretion in patients affected by functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA). Design: Controlled clinical study. Setting: Patients with FHA in a clinical research environment. Patient(s): Twelve hypogonadotropic patients affected by FHA. Intervention(s): Pulsatility study of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) test (10 mg in bolus) at baseline condition and after 8 weeks of therapy with 2 mg/day of estriol. Main Outcome Measure(s): Measurements of plasma LH, FSH, estradiol (E2), androstenedione (A), 17a-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), cortisol, androstenedione (A), testosterone (T), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4), and insulin, and pulse detection. Result(s): After treatment, the FHA patients showed a statistically significant increase of LH plasma levels (from 0.7 \AE{} 0.1 mIU/mL to 3.5 \AE{} 0.3 mIU/mL) and a statistically significant increase of LH pulse amplitude with no changes in LH pulse frequency. In addition, the LH response to the GnRH bolus was a statistically significant increase. Conclusion(s): Estriol administration induced the increase of LH plasma levels in FHA and improved GnRH-induced LH secretion. These findings suggest that estriol administration modulates the neuroendocrine control of the hypothalamus-pituitary unit and induces the recovery of LH synthesis and secretion in hypogonadotropic patients with FHA.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetic lipoprotein disorders have been associated with premature coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS AND RESULTS: The prevalence of such disorders was determined in 102 kindreds (n = 603 subjects) in whom the proband had significant CAD documented by angiography before the age of 60 years. Fasting plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, apolipoprotein (apo) B, and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] values above the 90th percentile and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apo A-I below the 10th percentile of age- and sex-specific norms were defined as abnormal. An abnormality was noted in 73.5\% of probands compared with 38.2\% in age-matched controls (p less than 0.001), with a low HDL cholesterol level (hypoalphalipoproteinemia) being the most common abnormality (39.2\% of cases). In these kindreds, 54\% had a defined phenotypic familial lipoprotein or apolipoprotein disorder. The following frequencies were observed: Lp(a) excess, 18.6\% (includes 12.7\% with no other dyslipidemias); hypertriglyceridemia with hypoalphalipoproteinemia, 14.7\%; combined hyperlipidemia, 13.7\% (11.7\% with and 2.0\% without hypoalphalipoproteinemia); hyperapobetalipoproteinemia (elevated apo B only), 5\%; hypoalphalipoproteinemia, 4\%; hypercholesterolemia (elevated LDL only), 3\%; hypertriglyceridemia, 1\%; decreased apo A-I only, 1\%. Overall, 54\% of the probands had a familial dyslipidemia; unclassifiable lipid disorders (spouse also affected) were found in 3\%. No identifiable familial dyslipidemia was noted in 43\% of kindreds of those; nearly half (45\%) had a sporadic lipid disorder. Parent-offspring and proband-spouse correlations for these biochemical variables revealed that lipoprotein and apolipoprotein levels are in part genetically determined, with Lp(a) showing the highest degree of parent-offspring correlation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that more than half of patients with premature CAD have a familial lipoprotein disorder, with Lp(a) excess, hypertriglyceridemia with hypoalphalipoproteinemia, and combined hyperlipidemia with hypoalphalipoproteinemia being the most common abnormalities.},

Each of these four manipulations was followed by a day-time sleep beginning at 1100 hr. No significant changes in the duration of the first sleep cycle appeared. As the prior sleep loss increased both SWE (slow-wave energy; accumulated EEG delta power density) and SW A (slow-wave activity; EEG delta power per minute) increased during the IlOO-hr sleeps. This was observed for the entire cycles, the nonrapid eye movement (NREM) periods, and the SWS periods, respectively. SWS latency decreased and SWS duration increased, respectively, markedly with prior waking. Also, for the progressively postponed sleeps (started at 2300 hr, 0300 hr, 0500 hr and 1100 hr) there were changes, but not as clear. After 28 hr of continuous waking there was a marked increase ofSWA during SWS. Also, at this level there was a spill over of SW A to the second cycle. It is suggested that there might be a limit to the amount and intensity of SWS that can be accommodated in the first sleep cycle and that this limit is reached before the appearance of REM sleep.},

To date, there is only scarce data evaluating nutrition among CrossFit training and they mostly focus on selected nutritional interventions. Therefore, the purpose of this descriptive study was the assessment of dietary intake and nutritional status in a selected group of CrossFit-trained participants. The study consisted of 62 CrossFit athletes (31 men and 31 women, aged 31.0 {$\pm$} 5.2 and 30.0 {$\pm$} 4.3 years, respectively). Body composition was analyzed by electrical bioimpedance. Dietary intake was assessed using a standardized 3-day food record. Body fat percentage for females and males was 20.3 {$\pm$} 4.3\% and 13.7 {$\pm$} 3.3\% respectively. The energy intake in the diet was lower (\textasciitilde 1700 kcal in women and \textasciitilde 2300 kcal in men) than the recommended demand. Moreover, low consumption of carbohydrates was stated, as well as an inadequate intake of folate, vitamin E (in women), and minerals, such as Fe and Ca (in women). The energy, carbohydrate, iron, and calcium intake in the CrossFit participants' diet was too low in comparison to recommendations. It seems justified to educate athletes and coaches about nutritional habits, and individual energy and nutrients requirements.},

  abstract = {Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is the most abundant and the most atherogenic class of cholesterol-carrying lipoproteins in human plasma. The level of plasma LDL is regulated by the LDL receptor, a cell surface glycoprotein that removes LDL from plasma by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Defects in the gene encoding the LDL receptor, which occur in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, elevate the plasma LDL level and produce premature coronary atherosclerosis. The physiologically important LDL receptors are located primarily in the liver, where their number is regulated by the cholesterol content of the hepatocyte. When the cholesterol content of hepatocytes is raised by ingestion of diets high in saturated fat and cholesterol, LDL receptors fall and plasma LDL levels rise. Conversely, maneuvers that lower the cholesterol content of hepatocytes, such as ingestion of drugs that inhibit cholesterol synthesis (mevinolin or compactin) or prevent the reutilization of bile acids (cholestyramine or colestipol), stimulate LDL receptor production and lower plasma LDL levels. The normal process of receptor regulation can therefore be exploited in powerful and novel ways so as to reverse hypercholesterolemia and prevent atherosclerosis.},

This guideline was funded by the Endocrine Society. Objective: To formulate clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA). Participants: The participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed task force of eight experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. Evidence: This evidence-based guidelinewas developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The task force commissioned two systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies. Consensus Process: One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Endocrine Society committees and members and cosponsoring organizations reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of this guideline. Conclusions: FHA is a form of chronic anovulation, not due to identifiable organic causes, but often associated with stress, weight loss, excessive exercise, or a combination thereof. Investigations should include assessment of systemic and endocrinologic etiologies, as FHA is a diagnosis of exclusion. A multidisciplinary treatment approach is necessary, including medical, dietary, and mental health support. Medical complications include, among others, bone loss and infertility, and appropriate therapies are under debate and investigation. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 102: 1413-1439, 2017).},

  abstract = {Lipoprotein lipid physiology in pregnancy has important implications for the developing fetus and newborn as well as the mother. Cholesterol is essential for normal fetal development. It is key in the formation of cell membranes. In pregnancy, multiple physiological changes occur that contribute to the alterations in lipid profiles of healthy, gestating women. Initially, there is an anabolic phase with an increase in lipid synthesis and fat storage in preparation for the increases in fetal energy needs in late pregnancy. During the third trimester, lipid physiology transitions to a net catabolic phase with a breakdown of fat deposits. The catabolism increases substrates for the growing fetus. Overall, the changes in lipid physiology throughout the course of pregnancy allow for proper nutrients for the fetus and they reflect increasing insulin resistance in the mother. Our understanding and appreciation of the full scope and implications of dyslipidemia in pregnancy on both maternal and fetal outcomes is not complete; however, it is well known that dyslipidemia in pregnancy is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes affecting both maternal and fetal health. There are direct implications of dyslipidemia on perinatal outcomes as well as intricate relationships between dyslipidemia and other comorbid intrauterine conditions. There is also developing research indicating that the in utero environment influences susceptibility to chronic diseases later in life, a concept known as ``developmental programming.'' Given all of these implications of dyslipidemia in pregnancy on maternal and fetal health, it is prudent to screen women for lipid disorders. The ideal time for this is before conception; if a woman has not been screening before pregnancy, the initial obstetrical visit is ideal. Abnormal lipids should be followed through pregnancy. The treatment of dyslipidemia in pregnancy is multifactorial, including diet, exercise and weight management. Medical management is complicated by FDA classifications for medication risks to the fetus, however some evidence indicates there may be permissible pharmacological treatments for dyslipidemia in pregnancy.},

Therapeutics that may assist to contain its rapid spread and reduce its high mortality rates are urgently needed. Developing vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may take many months. Moreover, vaccines based on viral-encoded peptides may not be effective against future coronavirus epidemics, as virus mutations could make them futile. Indeed, new Influenza virus strains emerge every year, requiring new immunizations. A tentative suggestion based on existing therapeutics, which would likely be resistant to new coronavirus mutations, is to use available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the aggressiveness and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 virus infections. This idea is based on observations that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) very likely serves as the binding site for SARS-CoV-2, the strain implicated in the current COVID-19 epidemic, similarly to strain SARS-CoV implicated in the 2002?2003 SARS epidemic. This commentary elaborates on the idea of considering AT1R blockers as tentative treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and proposes a research direction based on datamining of clinical patient records for assessing its feasibility.},

Currently, several therapies are emerging and undergoing trials in animal models; these focus on the manipulation and administration of several growth factors implicated with healing. However, limitations include in vivo instability, reliance on biocompatible and robust carriers and restricted application procedures (local and direct). The aim of this paper is therefore to critically review the current literature surrounding the use of BPC 157, as a feasible therapy for healing and functional restoration of soft tissue damage, with a focus on tendon, ligament and skeletal muscle healing. Currently, all studies investigating BPC 157 have demonstrated consistently positive and prompt healing effects for various injury types, both traumatic and systemic and for a plethora of soft tissues. However, to date, the majority of studies have been performed on small rodent models and the efficacy of BPC 157 is yet to be confirmed in humans. Further, over the past two decades, only a handful of research groups have performed in-depth studies regarding this peptide. Despite this, it is apparent that BPC 157 has huge potential and following further development has promise as a therapy to conservatively treat or aid recovery in hypovascular and hypocellular soft tissues such as tendon and ligaments. Moreover, skeletal muscle injury models have suggested a beneficial effect not only for disturbances that occur as a result of direct trauma but also for systemic insults including hyperkalamia and hypermagnesia. Promisingly, there are few studies reporting any adverse reactions to the administration of BPC 157, although there is still a need to understand the precise healing mechanisms for this therapy to achieve clinical realisation.},

The dentist should develop a basic action plan that is understood by all staff members. The goal is to manage the patient's care until he or she recovers fully or until help arrives. The most important aspect of almost all medical emergencies in dentistry is to prevent or correct insufficient oxygenation of the brain or heart. The dentist or a staff member needs to position (P) the patient appropriately. He or she then needs to assess and, if needed, manage the airway (A), breathing (B) and circulation (C). The dentist and staff members then can consider ``D,'' which stands for definitive treatment, differential diagnosis, drugs or defibrillation.},

Although endocrine balance and an optimal body composition are essential for top elite performance, these parameters have not yet been explored fully in Olympic sportswomen. The objective of this study, therefore, was to characterize the menstrual status, body composition, and endocrine balance in female Olympic athletes participating in different disciplines.         Methods:~         Ninety Swedish female Olympic athletes underwent a gynecologic examination that included vaginal examination by ultrasound and determination of body composition. In addition, blood samples were collected for the analysis of reproductive hormones and biomarkers of energy availability.         Results:~         Of all the athletes, 47\% were using hormonal contraception (HC). Menstrual dysfunction (MD) was common (27\%) among those not using HC and, particularly, in endurance athletes. However, the proportion of body fat and biomarkers of energy availability were within the normal ranges and none exhibited osteopenia. On the contrary, bone mineral density was generally high, particularly in the power athletes. The most common diagnosis associated with MD was polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and not hypothalamic inhibition because of energy deficiency.         Conclusions:~         Female Olympic athletes participating in different sports were found to have an anabolic body composition and biomarkers of energy availability within the normal ranges. Most cases of menstrual disturbances observed were due to PCOS. These findings challenge the contemporary concept that reproductive dysfunction in sportswomen is typically a consequence of chronic energy deficiency.},

We examined clinical features of migraine with aura in a large group of patients enrolled in a clinical trial, and compared retrospective migraine attack characteristics reported upon enrollment in the trial with those recorded prospectively in the trial.MethodsPatients with migraine (n?=?267) with typical visual aura in more than 30\% of their attacks were enrolled from 16 centers for a clinical trial. Upon enrollment, patients provided a detailed retrospective description of the clinical features of their attacks of migraine. During the trial, clinical symptoms in migraine attacks starting with aura were recorded prospectively in 861 attacks.ResultsRetrospectively reported visual aura symptoms were variable and often overlapping; the most common symptoms were dots or flashing lights, wavy or jagged lines, blind spots, and tunnel vision. Multiple patients reported more than one visual phenomenon. Approximately half of the patients reported nonvisual aura symptoms, the most common were numbness and tingling, followed by difficulty in recalling or speaking words. A significant percentage of patients also reported a change in olfaction. There were several inconsistencies between the features of prospectively recorded and retrospectively reported attacks. Headache, nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were all less common in prospectively recorded attacks as compared with retrospective reporting. Nausea was prospectively recorded in only 51\% of attacks and mostly with mild intensity. The occurrence and severity of nausea was reduced with advancing patient age. Phonophobia was not consistently recorded in conjunction with photophobia.ConclusionThese findings are consistent with variable involvement of different brain regions during a migraine attack. The variable occurrence of nausea, and phonophobia in conjunction with photophobia, both defining features of migraine, may be an important consideration in designing clinical studies of migraine in which prospectively recorded attacks are diagnosed based on these clinical features.},

The susceptible individuals are assumed to move stochastically from one place to another. The virus particle transmission rate is assumed to obey the Eyring's rate process theory and also controlled by how much free volume available in a system. The transmission process is considered to be a sequential chemical reaction, and the concentrations or fractions of four epidemiological compartments, the susceptible, the exposed, the infected, and the removed, can be derived and calculated. The obtained equations show that the basic reproduction number, R0, is not a constant, dependent on the volume fraction of virus particles, virus particle size, and virus particle packing structure, the energy barrier associated with susceptible individuals, and environment temperature. The developed models are applied to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) transmission and make predictions on peak time, peak infected, and R0. Our work provides a simple and straightforward approach to estimate how infection diseases evolve and how many people may be infected.},

Specific learning objectives associated with this include understanding the effects of posture on blood pressure and heart rate, coupled with the role of caffeine in modifying this response. Inclusion of ECG measurements, coupled with heart rate variability analysis, added a demonstration of the contribution made by the autonomic nervous system under these conditions. We clearly demonstrate that the cardiac work, estimated as rate-pressure product, necessary to undertake the transition from supine to standing, is fixed for a given group of subjects. However, the individual contribution of heart rate and systolic pressure to the cardiac workload is subject to the external factors of gravity and caffeine. Such an activity also demonstrates additional benefits, including unstructured teaching opportunities to augment classroom learning associated with integrative physiology and also the discussion of ethical issues with regard to human experimentation.},

We used bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression to identify risk factors for mortality. Results: The analysis comprised all 100 COVID-19 con rmed cases during the study period. The median age was 85 years; 62\% were female. The case fatality rate was 20\%. In the bivariate analysis, male gender, fever, respiratory symptoms, severe cognitive decline, a low Barthel index, and lymphocytopenia were signi cantly associated with mortality. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identi ed male gender, low Barthel index, no pharmacological treatment, and lymphocytopenia as independent risk factors associated with mortality. Conclusions and Implications: Male gender, low Barthel index, no pharmacological treatment and lymphocytopenia are independent risk factors for COVID-19 mortality in institutionalized elderly patients in long-term care nursing homes. Treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was associated with lower mortality in these patients.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h2{$><$}p{$>$}Caffeine consumption has been receiving increased interest from both the medical and lay press, especially given the increased amounts now available in energy products. Acute ingestion of caffeine usually increases cardiac work; however, caffeine impairs the expected proportional increase in myocardial blood flow to match this increased work of the heart, most notably during exercise. This appears to be mainly due to caffeine's effect on blocking adenosine-induced vasodilatation in the coronary arteries in normal healthy subjects. This review summarizes the available medical literature specifically relating to pure caffeine tablet ingestion and reduced exercise coronary blood flow, and suggests possible mechanisms. Further studies are needed to evaluate this effect for other common caffeine-delivery systems, including coffee, energy beverages, and energy gels, which are often used for exercise performance enhancement, especially in teenagers and young athletes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We recruited adult volunteers with confirmed influenza and suspected cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to wear medical masks and self-designed triple-layer cotton masks in a regular bedroom and a car with air conditioning. Four 1-hour repeated measurements (two measurements for bedroom the others for car) of particles with a size range of 20\textendash 1000~nm measured by number concentrations (NC0.02\textendash 1), temperature and relatively humidity, and cough/sneeze counts per hour were conducted for each volunteer. The paired t-tests were used for within-group comparisons in a bedroom and in a car. The results showed that there was no significant difference in NC0.02\textendash 1 or cough/sneeze counts between volunteers with medical masks and cotton masks in a bedroom or a car. We concluded that the cotton mask could be a potential substitute for medical mask for respiratory infection person in microenvironment with air conditioning.

Our study aimed to study the epidemiological, clinical characteristics and therapies of these severe cases in Jiangsu Province.Methods: Patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who were admitted to 12 first-tier hospitals in Jiangsu Province between Jan 24 and Feb 23, 2020 were retrospective enrolled. All diagnosis were confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Clinical characteristics and prognosis of 60 cases with COVID-19 were compared and analysis.Findings: A total of 631 infected cases with COVID-19 in Jiangsu Province, 60 of which were severe cases. Up until Feb 23, 2020, the mortality rate of these severe patients was 0\%. The median age was 57 years (range, 26 to 97), and 58 {$\cdot$} 3\% were man. The body mass index (BMI) of these patients was higher, with an average of 25 kg/m2.  51 {$\cdot$} 7\% of cases had at least one comorbidity. Mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score on admission was 14{$\pm$}5. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) appeared in 15\% of the patients. White blood cell counts decreased in 45 {$\cdot$} 0\% of patients, lymphopenia in 63 {$\cdot$} 3\%, thrombocytopenia in 13 {$\cdot$} 3\%, and procalcitonin levels in 88 {$\cdot$} 3\% of the patients were less than 0 {$\cdot$} 5 ng/mL. There were no statistically significant differences in immunoglobulin therapy and glucocorticoids therapy between the improvement and deterioration subgroups ( P {$>$}0 {$\cdot$} 05). Logistic regression analysis showed higher levels of troponin T (odds ratio [OR]: 1 {$\cdot$} 04; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1 {$\cdot$} 00-1 {$\cdot$} 08; P =0 {$\cdot$} 04), antiviral therapy with interferon (OR: 6 {$\cdot$} 33; 95\% CI: 1 {$\cdot$} 18-33  䟞 P =0 {$\cdot$} 03), and the application of non-invasive mechanical ventilation (OR: 1 {$\cdot$} 99; 95\%CI: 1 {$\cdot$} 17-3 {$\cdot$} 41; P =0 {$\cdot$} 01) correlated with disease progression, wherea higher lymphocyte count (OR: 0 {$\cdot$} 11; 95\% CI: 0 {$\cdot$} 02-0 {$\cdot$} 57; P =0 {$\cdot$} 01) and prone ventilation were associated with improvement (OR: 0 {$\cdot$} 11; 95\% CI: 0 {$\cdot$} 01-0 {$\cdot$} 98; P =0 {$\cdot$} 04).Interpretation: The COVID-19 had a low mortality rate in Jiangsu Province, China. In patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, early comprehensive care and oxygen support therapy are the key to success treatment. With non-invasive ventilation or high flow nasal cannula combined prone ventilation might additionally improve hypoxia and protect organ function.Funding Statement: The authors stated that this research was not funded.Declaration of Interests: The authors declare no financial conflicts of interest.Ethics Approval Statement: The research was approved by independent Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University.

  abstract = {Background. Essential hypertension (EH) and cardiovascular disease are common, multifactorial disorders likely to be influenced by multiple genes of modest effect. The C677T methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphism is related to MTHFR enzyme activity and to plasma homocysteine (Hcy) concentration. This study was designed to investigate an association of this polymorphism with coronary artery disease (CAD), EH, and healthy subjects. Methods. In this study, we measured serum folate, serum vitamin B12, and plasma homocysteine and determined the MTHFR C677T genotype of 78 patients with essential hypertension, 100 patients with coronary artery disease, and 100 healthy subjects. MTHFR genotypes were assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results. CC, CT, and TT genotype frequencies were 52, 44.0, and 4.0\% in patients with CAD, respectively. In patients with essential hypertension, the CC, CT, and TT genotype frequencies were 46.2, 41.0, and 12.8\%, respectively. In control subjects, the CC, CT, and TT genotype frequencies were 72.0, 26.0, and 2.0\%, respectively. The C allele was significantly more frequent in controls compared with patients with EH ( p !0.05), and CC genotypes were more frequent in controls compared to patients with EH and CAD. Homocysteine level was higher in TT genotypes in CAD patients compared with CC and CT genotypes ( p !0.01). MTHFR gene polymorphism is an independent risk factor for EH but not for CAD. Conclusions. The TT genotype of the 677C/T MTHFR polymorphism is associated with EH and CAD. In addition, TT genotypes had higher plasma Hcy levels in CAD patients compared with CC and CT genotypes. MTHFR gene polymorphism is an independent risk factor for EH but not for CAD. \'O 2008 IMSS. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {We employed homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells to produce mice lacking functional LDL receptor genes. Homozygous male and female mice lacking LDL receptors (LDLR-/- mice) were viable and fertile. Total plasma cholesterol levels were twofold higher than those of wild-type litter-mates, owing to a seven- to ninefold increase in intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL) and LDL without a significant change in HDL. Plasma triglyceride levels were normal. The half-lives for intravenously administered 125I-VLDL and 125I-LDL were prolonged by 30-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively, but the clearance of 125I-HDL was normal in the LDLR-/- mice. Unlike wild-type mice, LDLR-/- mice responded to moderate amounts of dietary cholesterol (0.2\% cholesterol/10\% coconut oil) with a major increase in the cholesterol content of IDL and LDL particles. The elevated IDL/LDL level of LDLR-/- mice was reduced to normal 4 d after the intravenous injection of a recombinant replication-defective adenovirus encoding the human LDL receptor driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. The virus restored expression of LDL receptor protein in the liver and increased the clearance of 125I-VLDL. We conclude that the LDL receptor is responsible in part for the low levels of VLDL, IDL, and LDL in wild-type mice and that adenovirus-encoded LDL receptors can acutely reverse the hypercholesterolemic effects of LDL receptor deficiency.},

Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Tertiary care teaching hospital. Population Adolescents and young women, 15\textendash 30 years of age, diagnosed with FHA along with concurrent signs of hyperandrogenism (n=22) and body mass index matched control groups consisting of 22 women in each group of FHA-EX and FHA-AN. Main outcomes 1) Reproductive hormone profile: luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), total testosterone, pelvic ultrasound features. 2) Metabolic function and skeletal health markers: fasting glucose, cholesterol, number of stress fractures and bone mineral density as assessed by spine dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry z scores. Results FHA-EX+HA group was older at diagnosis compared to the other groups with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 22 (18.75\textendash 25.25) years versus (vs) 17.5 (15.75\textendash 19) for FHA-EX; (P{$<$}0.01) and 18 (16\textendash 22.25) years for FHA-AN (P=0.01). There were no differences among the groups based on number of hours of exercise per week, type of physical activity or duration of amenorrhea. Median (IQR) LH/FSH ratio was higher in FHA-EX+HA than both other groups, 1.44 (1.03\textendash 1.77) vs 0.50 (0.20\textendash 0.94) for FHA-EX and 0.67 (0.51\textendash 0.87) for FHA-AN (P{$<$}0.01 for both). Total testosterone concentrations were not different among the groups. Median (IQR) fasting serum glucose concentration was higher in FHA-EX+HA vs FHA-EX, 88.5 mg/dL (82.8\textendash 90 mg/dL) vs 83.5 mg/dL (78.8\textendash 86.3 mg/dL) (P=0.01) but not different from FHA-AN (P=0.31). Percentage of women with stress fractures was lower in FHA-EX+HA (4.5\%) as compared to both FHA-EX (27.3\%) and FHA-AN (50\%); P=0.04 and 0.01 respectively. The LH/FSH ratio was weakly positively associated with serum glucose (adjusted r2=0.102; P=0.01) as well as with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry spine score (adjusted r2=0.191; P=0.04) in the entire cohort. Conclusion In a small cohort of female athletes with hyperandrogenism, a distinct reproductive hormone profile consisting of higher LH to FHS ratio may be associated with adverse metabolic health markers but improved skeletal health.},

Currently there is no targeted therapeutics and effective treatment options remain very limited. In order to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, we initiated a program of combined structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening to identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 virus main protease (Mpro). Mpro is a key CoV enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive drug target for this virus. Here, we identified a mechanism-based inhibitor, N3, by computer-aided drug design and subsequently determined the crystal structure of COVID-19 virus Mpro in complex with this compound. Next, through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed over 10,000 compounds including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and other pharmacologically active compounds as inhibitors of Mpro. Six of these inhibit Mpro with IC50 values ranging from 0.67 to 21.4 {$\mu$}M. Ebselen also exhibited strong antiviral activity in cell-based assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy, which can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new infectious diseases where no specific drugs or vaccines are available.},

Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Denmark; the Copenhagen General Population Study recruited in 2003-15 with a median follow-up of 9.4 years. Participants Individuals randomly selected from the national Danish Civil Registration System. Main outcome measures Baseline levels of LDL-C associated with risk of mortality were evaluated on a continuous scale (restricted cubic splines) and by a priori defined centile categories with Cox proportional hazards regression models. Main outcome was all cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were cause specific mortality (cardiovascular, cancer, and other mortality). Results Among 108 243 individuals aged 20-100, 11 376 (10.5\%) died during the study, at a median age of 81. The association between levels of LDL-C and the risk of all cause mortality was U shaped, with low and high levels associated with an increased risk of all cause mortality. Compared with individuals with concentrations of LDL-C of 3.4-3.9 mmol/L (132-154 mg/dL; 61st-80th centiles), the multivariable adjusted hazard ratio for all cause mortality was 1.25 (95\% confidence interval 1.15 to 1.36) for individuals with LDL-C concentrations of less than 1.8 mmol/L ({$<$}70 mg/dL; 1st-5th centiles) and 1.15 (1.05 to 1.27) for LDL-C concentrations of more than 4.8 mmol/L ({$>$}189 mg/dL; 96th-100th centiles). The concentration of LDL-C associated with the lowest risk of all cause mortality was 3.6 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) in the overall population and in individuals not receiving lipid lowering treatment, compared with 2.3 mmol/L (89 mg/dL) in individuals receiving lipid lowering treatment. Similar results were seen in men and women, across age groups, and for cancer and other mortality, but not for cardiovascular mortality. Any increase in LDL-C levels was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction. Conclusions In the general population, low and high levels of LDL-C were associated with an increased risk of all cause mortality, and the lowest risk of all cause mortality was found at an LDL-C concentration of 3.6 mmol/L (140 mg/dL).},

  abstract = {BackgroundThe thermogenic and metabolic properties of capsinoids appear to mimic those of the more pungent sister compound capsaicin. However, few data exist on how capsinoid ingestion affects energy expenditure in humans and no data exist on its interaction with exercise. We aimed to determine how ingestion of capsinoids affected energy expenditure, lipid oxidation and blood metabolites at rest and during moderate intensity exercise.MethodsTwelve healthy young men (age = 24.3 {$\pm$} 3 yr, BMI = 25.5 {$\pm$} 1.7 kg{$\cdot$}m-2) were studied on two occasions in a double-blind design following ingestion of either placebo or 10 mg of purified capsinoids at rest, after 90 min of cycling at 55\% VO2 peak, and for 30 min into recovery. Subjects ingested the capsules 30 min prior to exercise.ResultsAt rest, following ingestion of capsinoids, we observed increases in VO2 and plasma norepinephrine levels, and decreases in concentrations of serum free fatty acids, plasma glycerol and the respiratory exchange ratio (all P {$<$} 0.05). At exercise onset, we observed a blunted accumulation of blood lactate with capsinoid ingestion vs. placebo (P {$<$} 0.05). There were no other significant differences between the conditions during or post-exercise.ConclusionThe ingestion of 10 mg of capsinoids increased adrenergic activity, energy expenditure, and resulted in a shift in substrate utilization toward lipid at rest but had little effect during exercise or recovery. The changes we observed confirm previous data on the thermogenic and metabolic effects of capsinoids at rest and further promote its potential role as an adjunct weight loss aid, in addition to diet and exercise.},

  abstract = {Abstract           The pandemic caused by emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 presents a serious global public health emergency in urgent need of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry depends on binding between the viral Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) target cell receptor. Here, we report on the isolation and characterization of 206 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) derived from single B cells of eight SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. These mAbs come from diverse families of antibody heavy and light chains without apparent enrichment for particular families in the repertoire. In samples from one patient selected for further analyses, we found coexistence of germline and germline divergent clones. Both clone types demonstrated impressive binding and neutralizing activity against pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2. However, the antibody neutralizing potency is determined by competition with ACE2 receptor for RBD binding. Surprisingly, none of the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies nor the infected plasma cross-reacted with RBDs from either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV although substantial plasma cross-reactivity to the trimeric Spike proteins from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was found. These results suggest that antibody response to RBDs is viral species-specific while that cross-recognition target regions outside the RBD. The specificity and neutralizing characteristics of this plasma cross-reactivity requires further investigation. Nevertheless, the diverse and potent neutralizing antibodies identified here are promising candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic SARS-CoV-2 interventions.},

In 2003\textendash 2004, 18 of the original 36 participants were still alive and were interviewed. Many came from the Historic Peace Churches (Mennonite, Brethren, and Quaker), and all expressed strong convictions about nonviolence and wanting to make a meaningful contribution during the war. Despite ethical issues about subjecting healthy humans to starvation, the men interviewed were unanimous in saying that they would do it all over again, even after knowing the suffering that they had experienced. After the experiment ended, many of the participants went on to rebuilding war-torn Europe, working in the ministries, diplomatic careers, and other activities related to nonviolence.},

Specifically, we examined whether the cumulative effect of resisting desires, a measure of self-regulatory resource depletion (), relates to bedtime procrastination. Participants (N = 218) reported how many desires they had tried to resist during the previous day and the extent of their bedtime procrastination. Results show that people who attempted to resist more desires were more likely to engage in bedtime procrastination, suggesting that people may be less likely to stick to their intended bedtime after a particularly taxing day.

However, despite clinical evidence of its efficacy, the details of its mechanism remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the site of action and sleep-promoting mechanisms of glycine in rats. In acute sleep disturbance, oral administration of glycine-induced non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and shortened NREM sleep latency with a simultaneous decrease in core temperature. Oral and intracerebroventricular injection of glycine elevated cutaneous blood flow (CBF) at the plantar surface in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in heat loss. Pretreatment with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists AP5 and CGP78608 but not the glycine receptor antagonist strychnine inhibited the CBF increase caused by glycine injection into the brain. Induction of c-Fos expression was observed in the hypothalamic nuclei, including the medial preoptic area (MPO) and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) shell after glycine administration. Bilateral microinjection of glycine into the SCN elevated CBF in a dose-dependent manner, whereas no effect was observed when glycine was injected into the MPO and dorsal subparaventricular zone. In addition, microinjection of D-serine into the SCN also increased CBF, whereas these effects were blocked in the presence of L-701324. SCN ablation completely abolished the sleep-promoting and hypothermic effects of glycine. These data suggest that exogenous glycine promotes sleep via peripheral vasodilatation through the activation of NMDA receptors in the SCN shell.},

Here, we describe the development of a coronavirus antigen microarray containing immunologically significant antigens from SARS-CoV-2, in addition to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, common human coronavirus strains, and other common respiratory viruses. A preliminary study of human sera collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic demonstrates overall high IgG reactivity to common human coronaviruses and low IgG reactivity to epidemic coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, with some cross-reactivity of conserved antigenic domains including S2 domain of spike protein and nucleocapsid protein. This array can be used to answer outstanding questions regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection, including whether baseline serology for other coronaviruses impacts disease course, how the antibody response to infection develops over time, and what antigens would be optimal for vaccine development.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The relationship of OxPL/apoB levels to future cardiovascular events is not known. METHODS AND RESULTS - The Bruneck study is a prospective population-based survey of 40- to 79-year-old men and women recruited in 1990. Plasma levels of OxPL/apoB and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] were measured in 765 subjects in 1995 and incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and transient ischemic attack, was assessed from 1995 to 2005. During the follow-up period, 82 subjects developed CVD. In multivariable analysis, which included traditional risk factors, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) activity, subjects in the highest tertile of OxPL/apoB had a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular events than those in the lowest tertile (hazard ratio[95\% CI] 2.4[1.3 to 4.3], P=0.004). The strength of the association between OxPL/apoB and CVD risk was amplified with increasing Lp-PLA2 activity (P=0.018 for interaction). Moreover, OxPL/apoB levels predicted future cardiovascular events beyond the information provided by the Framingham Risk Score (FRS). The effects of OxPL/apoB and Lp(a) were not independent of each other but they were independent of all other measured risk factors. CONCLUSIONS - This study demonstrates that OxPL/apoB levels predict 10-year CVD event rates independently of traditional risk factors, hsCRP, and FRS. Increasing Lp-PLA2 activity further amplifies the risk of CVD mediated by OxPL/apoB. \textcopyright{} 2007 American Heart Association, Inc.},

The MTHFR 677C\textrightarrow T polymorphism is a genetic alteration in an enzyme involved in folate metabolism that causes elevated homocysteine concentrations, but its relevance to risk of CHD is uncertain.ObjectiveTo assess the relation of MTHFR 677C\textrightarrow T polymorphism and risk of CHD by conducting a meta-analysis of individual participant data from all case-control observational studies with data on this polymorphism and risk of CHD.Data SourcesStudies were identified by searches of the electronic literature (MEDLINE and Current Contents) for relevant reports published before June 2001 (using the search terms MTHFR and coronary heart disease), hand searches of reference lists of original studies and review articles (including meta-analyses) on this topic, and contact with investigators in the field.Study SelectionStudies were included if they had data on the MTHFR 677C\textrightarrow T genotype and a case-control design (retrospective or nested case-control) and involved CHD as an end point. Data were obtained from 40 (34 published and 6 unpublished) observational studies involving a total of 11 162 cases and 12 758 controls.Data ExtractionData were collected on MTHFR 677C\textrightarrow T genotype, case-control status, and plasma levels of homocysteine, folate, and other cardiovascular risk factors. Data were checked for consistency with the published article or with information provided by the investigators and converted into a standard format for incorporation into a central database. Combined odds ratios (ORs) for the association between the MTHFR 677C\textrightarrow T polymorphism and CHD were assessed by logistic regression.Data SynthesisIndividuals with the MTHFR 677 TT genotype had a 16\% (OR, 1.16; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.28) higher odds of CHD compared with individuals with the CC genotype. There was significant heterogeneity between the results obtained in European populations (OR, 1.14; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.28) compared with North American populations (OR, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.73-1.05), which might largely be explained by interaction between the MTHFR 677C\textrightarrow T polymorphism and folate status.ConclusionsIndividuals with the MTHFR 677 TT genotype had a significantly higher risk of CHD, particularly in the setting of low folate status. These results support the hypothesis that impaired folate metabolism, resulting in high homocysteine levels, is causally related to increased risk of CHD.},

  abstract = {The emergence of a pandemic affecting the respiratory system can result in a significant demand for face masks. This includes the use of cloth masks by large sections of the public, as can be seen during the current global spread of COVID-19. However, there is limited knowledge available on the performance of various commonly available fabrics used in cloth masks. Importantly, there is a need to evaluate filtration efficiencies as a function of aerosol particulate sizes in the 10 nm to 10 {$\mu$}m range, which is particularly relevant for respiratory virus transmission. We have carried out these studies for several common fabrics including cotton, silk, chiffon, flannel, various synthetics, and their combinations. Although the filtration efficiencies for various fabrics when a single layer was used ranged from 5 to 80\% and~5 to 95\% for particle sizes of {$<$}300 nm and {$>$}300 nm, respectively, the efficiencies improved when multiple layers were used and when using a specific combination of different fabrics. Filtration efficiencies of the hybrids (such as cotton\textendash silk, cotton\textendash chiffon, cotton\textendash flannel) was {$>$}80\% (for particles {$<$}300 nm) and {$>$}90\% (for particles {$>$}300 nm). We speculate that the enhanced performance of the hybrids is likely due to the combined effect of mechanical and electrostatic-based filtration. Cotton, the most widely used material for cloth masks performs better at higher weave densities (i.e., thread~count) and can make a significant difference in filtration efficiencies. Our studies also imply that gaps (as caused by an improper fit of the mask) can result in over a 60\% decrease in the filtration efficiency, implying the need for future cloth mask design studies to take into account issues of ``fit'' and leakage, while allowing the exhaled air to vent efficiently. Overall, we find that combinations of various commonly available fabrics used in cloth masks can potentially provide significant protection against the transmission of aerosol particles.},

  abstract = {Impaired sleep quality and quantity are associated with future morbidity and mortality. Exercise may be an effective non-pharmacological intervention to improve sleep, however, little is known on the effect of resistance exercise. Thus, we performed a systematic review of the literature to determine the acute and chronic effects of resistance exercise on sleep quantity and quality. Thirteen studies were included. Chronic resistance exercise improves all aspects of sleep, with the greatest benefit for sleep quality. These benefits of isolated resistance exercise are attenuated when resistance exercise is combined with aerobic exercise and compared to aerobic exercise alone. However, the acute effects of resistance exercise on sleep remain poorly studied and inconsistent. In addition to the sleep benefits, resistance exercise training improves anxiety and depression. These results suggest that resistance exercise may be an effective intervention to improve sleep quality. Further research is needed to better understand the effects of acute resistance exercise on sleep, the physiological mechanisms underlying changes in sleep, the changes in sleep architecture with chronic resistance exercise, as well its efficacy in clinical cohorts who commonly experience sleep disturbance. Future studies should also examine time-of-day and dose\textendash response effects to determine the optimal exercise prescription for sleep benefits.},

Heat loss was indirectly measured by means of the distal-to-proximal skin temperature gradient (DPG). A stepwise regression analysis revealed that the DPG was the best predictor variable for sleep-onset latency (compared with core body temperature or its rate of change, heart rate, melatonin onset, and subjective sleepiness ratings). This study provides evidence that selective vasodilation of distal skin regions (and hence heat loss) promotes the rapid onset of sleep.},

Genetic variants including a highly polymorphic copy number variation of the so called kringle IV repeats at this locus have a pronounced influence on Lp(a) concentrations. High concentrations of Lp(a) as well as genetic variants which are associated with high Lp(a) concentrations are both associated with cardiovascular disease which very strongly supports causality between Lp(a) concetrations and cardiovascular disease. This method of using a genetic variant that has a pronounced influence on a biomarker to support causality with an outcome is called Mendelian randomization approach and was applied for the first time two decades ago with data from Lp(a) and cardiovascular disease. This approach was also used to demonstrate a causal association between high Lp(a) concentrations and aortic valve stenosis, between low concentrations and type-2 diabetes mellitus and to exclude a causal association between Lp(a) concentrations and venous thrombosis. Considering the high frequency of these genetic variants in the population makes Lp(a) the strongest genetic risk factor for cardiovascular disease identified so far. Promising drugs that lower Lp(a) are on the horizon but their efficacy in terms of reducing clinical outcomes still has to be shown.},

A new coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the SARS pathogen, which triggered severe pneumonia and acute, often lethal, lung failure. Moreover, among infected individuals influenza such as the Spanish flu and the emergence of new respiratory disease viruses have caused high lethality resulting from acute lung failure. In cell lines, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a potential SARS-CoV receptor. The high lethality of SARS-CoV infections, its enormous economic and social impact, fears of renewed outbreaks as well as the potential misuse of such viruses as biologic weapons make it paramount to understand the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV. Here we provide the first genetic proof that ACE2 is a crucial SARS-CoV receptor in vivo. SARS-CoV infections and the Spike protein of the SARS-CoV reduce ACE2 expression. Notably, injection of SARS-CoV Spike into mice worsens acute lung failure in vivo that can be attenuated by blocking the renin-angiotensin pathway. These results provide a molecular explanation why SARS-CoV infections cause severe and often lethal lung failure and suggest a rational therapy for SARS and possibly other respiratory disease viruses.},

  abstract = {Background: This daily diary study investigates the phenomenon of bedtime procrastination. Bedtime procrastination is defined as going to bed later than intended, without having external reasons for doing so. We highlight the role chronotype (interindividual differences in biological preferences for sleep-wake-times) plays for bedtime procrastination. Moreover, we challenge the view that bedtime procrastination is the result of a lack of self-regulatory resources by investigating momentary self-regulatory resources as a predictor of day-specific bedtime procrastination., Methods: One-hundred and eight employees working in various industries completed a general electronic questionnaire (to assess chronotype and trait self-control) and two daily electronic questionnaires (to assess momentary self-regulatory resources before going to bed and day-specific bedtime procrastination) over the course of five work days, resulting in 399 pairs of matched day-next-day measurements., Results: Results of multilevel regression analyses showed that later chronotypes (also referred to as evening types or `owls') tended to report more bedtime procrastination on work days. Moreover, for late chronotypes, day-specific bedtime procrastination declined over the course of the work week. This pattern is in line with expectations derived from chronobiology and could not be explained by trait self-control. In addition, on evenings on which employees had less self-regulatory resources available before going to bed\textemdash compared to evenings on which they had more self-regulatory resources available before going to bed\textemdash employees showed lower bedtime procrastination. This finding contradicts the prevailing idea that bedtime procrastination is the result of a lack of self-regulatory resources., Conclusion: The findings of this study provide important implications for how bedtime procrastination should be positioned in the field of procrastination as self-regulatory failure and for how bedtime procrastination should be dealt with in practice.},

Hospitalization and early treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (HCQ-AZ) was proposed for the positive cases. Methods We retrospectively report the clinical management of 3,737 screened patients, including 3,119 (83.5\%) treated with HCQ-AZ (200 mg of oral HCQ, three times daily for ten days and 500 mg of oral AZ on day 1 followed by 250 mg daily for the next four days, respectively) for at least three days and 618 (16.5\%) patients treated with other regimen (``others''). Outcomes were death, transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU), {$\geq$}10 days of hospitalization and viral shedding. Results The patients' mean age was 45 (sd 17) years, 45\% were male, and the case fatality rate was 0.9\%. We performed 2,065 low-dose computed tomography (CT) scans highlighting lung lesions in 592 of the 991 (59.7\%) patients with minimal clinical symptoms (NEWS score = 0). A discrepancy between spontaneous dyspnoea, hypoxemia and lung lesions was observed. Clinical factors (age, comorbidities, NEWS-2 score), biological factors (lymphocytopenia; eosinopenia; decrease in blood zinc; and increase in D-dimers, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine phosphokinase, troponin and C-reactive protein) and moderate and severe lesions detected in low-dose CT scans were associated with poor clinical outcome. Treatment with HCQ-AZ was associated with a decreased risk of transfer to ICU or death (Hazard ratio (HR) 0.18 0.11\textendash 0.27), decreased risk of hospitalization {$\geq$}10 days (odds ratios 95\% CI 0.38 0.27\textendash 0.54) and shorter duration of viral shedding (time to negative PCR: HR 1.29 1.17\textendash 1.42). QTc prolongation ({$>$}60 ms) was observed in 25 patients (0.67\%) leading to the cessation of treatment in 12 cases including 3 cases with QTc{$>$} 500 ms. No cases of torsade de pointe or sudden death were observed.

  abstract = {Background In our institute in Marseille, France, we initiated early and massive screening for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Hospitalization and early treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (HCQ-AZ) was proposed for the positive cases. Methods We retrospectively report the clinical management of 3,737 screened patients, including 3,119 (83.5\%) treated with HCQ-AZ (200 mg of oral HCQ, three times daily for ten days and 500 mg of oral AZ on day 1 followed by 250 mg daily for the next four days, respectively) for at least three days and 618 (16.5\%) patients treated with other regimen (``others''). Outcomes were death, transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU), {$\geq$}10 days of hospitalization and viral shedding. Results The patients' mean age was 45 (sd 17) years, 45\% were male, and the case fatality rate was 0.9\%. We performed 2,065 low-dose computed tomography (CT) scans highlighting lung lesions in 592 of the 991 (59.7\%) patients with minimal clinical symptoms (NEWS score = 0). A discrepancy between spontaneous dyspnoea, hypoxemia and lung lesions was observed. Clinical factors (age, comorbidities, NEWS-2 score), biological factors (lymphocytopenia; eosinopenia; decrease in blood zinc; and increase in D-dimers, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine phosphokinase, troponin and C-reactive protein) and moderate and severe lesions detected in low-dose CT scans were associated with poor clinical outcome. Treatment with HCQ-AZ was associated with a decreased risk of transfer to ICU or death (Hazard ratio (HR) 0.18 0.11\textendash 0.27), decreased risk of hospitalization {$\geq$}10 days (odds ratios 95\% CI 0.38 0.27\textendash 0.54) and shorter duration of viral shedding (time to negative PCR: HR 1.29 1.17\textendash 1.42). QTc prolongation ({$>$}60 ms) was observed in 25 patients (0.67\%) leading to the cessation of treatment in 12 cases including 3 cases with QTc{$>$} 500 ms. No cases of torsade de pointe or sudden death were observed. Conclusion Although this is a retrospective analysis, results suggest that early diagnosis, early isolation and early treatment of COVID-19 patients, with at least 3 days of HCQ-AZ lead to a significantly better clinical outcome and a faster viral load reduction than other treatments.},

However, the relationship of smaller RBC with physical fitness was unknown. We included 2933 non-anemic military males (hemoglobin levels: 11.1-15.9 g/dL and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) {$<$}100 fL) in Taiwan during 2014. Aerobic fitness was assessed by time for a 3000-meter run, and anaerobic fitness was evaluated by numbers of sit-ups and push-ups, each performed within 2 minutes. Multiple linear and logistic regression models adjusting for age, service specialty, lipid profiles, and hemoglobin levels were used to determine the associations. Microcytosis and normocytosis were defined as MCV {$\leq$} 70 fL (n = 190) and MCV {$>$} 70 fL (n = 2743), respectively. The linear regression shows that as compared with microcytosis, normocytosis was associated with more numbers of sit-ups performed within 2 minutes ({$\beta$} = 1.51, P-value = 0.02). The logistic regression also reveals that those males with microcytosis had higher probability as the worst 10\% performers in the 2-minute push-up test (odds ratio: 1.91, 95\% confidence intervals: 1.18-3.12). By contrast, there was no association of microcytosis with 3000-meter running time. Our study suggests that non-anemic microcytosis was associated with lower anaerobic fitness but not with aerobic fitness. Whether the causative factors for microcytosis such as iron deficiency status and thalassemia trait unavailable in the study might account for the relationship needs further investigations.},

Sleep is essential for the recovery of the body from both physical and psychological fatigue suffered throughout the day, the refreshment of mind, and the restoration of energy for maintenance of bodily functions. Current thermal comfort theories and standards are mainly concerned with people in waking state. However, many problems regarding thermal environment are found within a few field surveys in bedrooms, pushing out the need to investigate thermal environment and thermal comfort for sleeping people. In this paper, the questions concerning the measurement and evaluation of human sleep quality, the correlation between thermal regulation system and sleep regulation, and the characteristics of night-time space cooling load etc. are answered. The evidences illustrating the effects of thermal parameters on human sleep quality are also provided, in an attempt to shed light on the thermal comfort requirements of sleeping people.},

Thorough validation of serological tests are required to facilitate their use in the accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmation of molecular results, contact tracing, and epidemiological studies. This study evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of nine commercially available serological tests. These included three enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and six point-of-care (POC) lateral flow tests. The assays were validated using serum samples from: i) SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients with a documented first day of disease; ii) archived sera obtained from healthy individuals before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China; iii) sera from patients with acute viral respiratory tract infections caused by other coronaviruses or noncoronaviruses; and iv) sera from patients positive for dengue virus, cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr virus. The results showed 100\% specificity for the Wantai SARS-CoV-2 Total Antibody ELISA, 93\% for the Euroimmun IgA ELISA, and 96\% for the Euroimmun IgG ELISA with sensitivities of 90\%, 90\%, and 65\%, respectively. The overall performance of the POC tests according to manufacturer were in the rank order of AutoBio Diagnostics {$>$} Dynamiker Biotechnology = CTK Biotech {$>$} Artron Laboratories {$>$} Acro Biotech {$\geq$} Hangzhou Alltest Biotech. Overall, these findings will facilitate selection of serological assays for the detection SARSCoV-2-specific antibodies towards diagnosis as well as sero-epidemiological and vaccine development studies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Macrophage scavenger receptors (MSRs) play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Therefore, local modulation of MSR activity could have a beneficial effect on atherogenesis. METHODS AND RESULTS: We cloned a secreted "decoy" MSR (sMSR) that contains an extracellular portion of the human MSR type AI and constructed an adenoviral vector that directs high-level expression of sMSR in macrophages under the control of the human CD68 promoter. Expression of the sMSR protein inhibited the degradation of (125)I-labeled acetylated LDL and oxidized LDL by murine macrophages up to 90\%. sMSRs also reduced acetylated LDL degradation in MSR knockout mouse peritoneal macrophages by 60\% to 80\%, which suggests that the decoy construct can compete for the uptake mediated via other related scavenger receptors. In addition, sMSRs inhibited foam-cell formation in murine macrophages in the presence of cytochalasin D. The mechanism of inhibition is through ligand binding to the sMSRs, which prevents the ligand binding to MSRs on cell membranes. CONCLUSIONS: The demonstration that recombinant adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of decoy sMSRs can block foam-cell formation suggests a possible new strategy for gene therapy of atherosclerosis and for the treatment of lipid accumulation after arterial manipulations.},

Relevant articles were retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP (Chinese) database. Results A total of 21 studies met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses suggest that mask use provided a significant protective effect (OR~=~0.35 and 95\% CI~=~0.24\textendash 0.51). Use of masks by healthcare workers (HCWs) and non-healthcare workers (Non-HCWs) can reduce the risk of respiratory virus infection by 80\% (OR~=~0.20, 95\% CI~=~0.11\textendash 0.37) and 47\% (OR~=~0.53, 95\% CI~=~0.36\textendash 0.79). The protective effect of wearing masks in Asia (OR~=~0.31) appeared to be higher than that of Western countries (OR~=~0.45). Masks had a protective effect against influenza viruses (OR~=~0.55), SARS (OR~=~0.26), and SARS-CoV-2 (OR~=~0.04). In the subgroups based on different study designs, protective effects of wearing mask were significant in cluster randomized trials and observational studies. Conclusions This study adds additional evidence of the enhanced protective value of masks, we stress that the use masks serve as an adjunctive method regarding the COVID-19 outbreak.},

Cholesterol depletion by pretreatment of Vero E6 cells with methyl-{$\beta$}-cyclodextrin (M{$\beta$}CD) inhibited the production of SARS-CoV particles released from the infected cells. This inhibition was prevented by addition of cholesterol to the culture medium, indicating that the reduction of virus particle release was caused by the loss of cholesterol in the cell membrane. In contrast, cholesterol depletion at the post-entry stage (3h post-infection) caused only a limited effect on virus particle release. Northern blot analysis revealed that the levels of viral mRNAs were significantly affected by pretreatment with M{$\beta$}CD, but not by treatment at 3h post-infection. Interestingly, no apparent evidence for colocalization of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 with lipid rafts in the membrane of Vero E6 cells was obtained. These results suggest that lipid rafts could contribute to SARS-CoV infection in the early replication process in Vero E6 cells.},

  abstract = {In humans, uric acid is the final oxidation product of purine catabolism. The serum uric acid level is based on the balance between the absorption, production and excretion of purine. Uric acid is similarly produced in the liver, adipose tissue and muscle and is primarily excreted through the urinary tract. Several factors, including a high-fructose diet and the use of xenobiotics and alcohol, contribute to hyperuricaemia. Hyperuricaemia belongs to a cluster of metabolic and haemodynamic abnormalities, called metabolic syndrome, characterised by abdominal obesity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia and hypertension. Hyperuricaemia reduction in the Pound mouse or fructose-fed rats, as well as hyperuricaemia induction by uricase inhibition in rodents and studies using cell culture have suggested that uric acid plays an important role in the development of metabolic syndrome. These studies have shown that high uric acid levels regulate the oxidative stress, inflammation and enzymes associated with glucose and lipid metabolism, suggesting a mechanism for the impairment of metabolic homeostasis. Humans lacking uricase, the enzyme responsible for uric acid degradation, are susceptible to these effects. In this review, we summarise the current knowledge of the effects of uric acid on the regulation of metabolism, primarily focusing on liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle.},

Design: Multicentre retrospective observational cohort study. Setting: Three multidisciplinary intensive care units (ICUs) in Hong Kong. Participants: All adult critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to ICUs in Hong Kong between 22 January and 11 February 2020. Main outcome measure: 28-day mortality. Results: Eight out of 49 patients with COVID-19 (16\%) were admitted to Hong Kong ICUs during the study period. The median age was 64.5 years (range, 42\textendash 70) with a median admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 6 (IQR, 4\textendash 7). Six patients (75\%) required mechanical ventilation, six patients (75\%) required vasopressors and two (25\%) required renal replacement therapy. None of the patients required prone ventilation, nitric oxide or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The median times to shock reversal and extubation were 9 and 11 days respectively. At 28 days, one patient (12\%) had died and the remaining seven (88\%) all survived to ICU discharge. Only one of the survivors (14\%) still required oxygen at 28 days. Conclusion: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 often require a moderate duration of mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support. Most of these patients recover and survive to ICU discharge with supportive care using lung protective ventilation strategies, avoiding excess fluids, screening and treating bacterial co-infection, and timely intubation. Lower rather than upper respiratory tract viral burden correlates with clinical severity of illness.},

The aim of this analysis is to determine the association of cardiovascular metabolic diseases with the development of COVID-19. Methods\hspace{0.6em} A meta-analysis of eligible studies that summarized the prevalence of cardiovascular metabolic diseases in COVID19 and compared the incidences of the comorbidities in ICU/severe and non-ICU/severe patients was performed. Embase and PubMed were searched for relevant studies. Results\hspace{0.6em} A total of six studies with 1527 patients were included in this analysis. The proportions of hypertension, cardiacerebrovascular disease and diabetes in patients with COVID-19 were 17.1\%, 16.4\% and 9.7\%, respectively. The incidences of hypertension, cardia-cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes were about twofolds, threefolds and twofolds, respectively, higher in ICU/severe cases than in their non-ICU/severe counterparts. At least 8.0\% patients with COVID-19 suffered the acute cardiac injury. The incidence of acute cardiac injury was about 13 folds higher in ICU/severe patients compared with the non-ICU/severe patients. Conclusion\hspace{0.6em} Patients with previous cardiovascular metabolic diseases may face a greater risk of developing into the severe condition and the comorbidities can also greatly affect the prognosis of the COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 can, in turn, aggravate the damage to the heart.},

  abstract = {One-tailed statistical tests are often used in ecology, animal behaviour and in most other fields in the biological and social sciences. Here we review the frequency of their use in the 1989 and 2005 volumes of two journals (Animal Behaviour and Oecologia), their advantages and disadvantages, the extensive erroneous advice on them in both older and modern statistics texts and their utility in certain narrow areas of applied research. Of those articles with data sets susceptible to one-tailed tests, at least 24\% in Animal Behaviour and at least 13\% in Oecologia used one-tailed tests at least once.They were used 35\% more frequently with nonparametric methods than with parametric ones and about twice as often in 1989 as in 2005. Debate in the psychological literature of the 1950s established the logical criterion that one-tailed tests should be restricted to situations where there is interest only in results in one direction. `Interest' should be defined; however, in terms of collective or societal interest and not by the individual investigator. By this `collective interest' criterion, all uses of one-tailed tests in the journals surveyed seem invalid. In his book Nonparametric Statistics, S. Siegel unrelentingly suggested the use of one-tailed tests whenever the investigator predicts the direction of a result.That work has been a major proximate source of confusion on this issue, but so are most recent statistics textbooks. The utility of one-tailed tests in research aimed at obtaining regulatory approval of new drugs and new pesticides is briefly described, to exemplify the narrow range of research situations where such tests can be appropriate.These situations are characterized by null hypotheses stating that the difference or effect size does not exceed, or is at least as great as, some `amount of practical interest'. One-tailed tests rarely should be used for basic or applied research in ecology, animal behaviour or any other science.},

People with hyperhidrosis may sweat even when the temperature is cool or when they are at rest.Despite prevalence of at least 1\% of the global population, Hyperhidrosis is still an unknown entity, for the most part -- an undertreated and even neglected medical condition. Moreover, there are few sources summarizing the knowledge on hyperhidrosis to a wider audience. The purpose of this book is to provide information regarding hyperhidrosis, ranging from basic information on pathophysiology to the most advanced therapeutic alternatives. From a therapeutic perspective, hyperhidrosis requires clinical treatment using topical and subdermal agents as well as surgical approaches. The book will not only cover these topics but will discuss all aspects of care -- from patient selection through post-surgical complications. Special attention will be given to sympathectomies. Medical and paramedical professionals, as well as students and researchers, interested in the topic will find the book comprehensive in scope and targeted in offering practical, clinical guidance. Diagnosis and Treatment of Hyperhidrosis - A Complete Guide counts with the collaboration of most renowned specialists of this field, and is intended as an easy to read and very practical reference book.},

  abstract = {Background: Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) outbreaks in Wuhan, China, healthcare systems capacities in highly endemic areas have been overwhelmed. Approaches to efficient management are urgently needed and key to a quicker control of the outbreaks and casualties. We aimed to characterize the clinical features of hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and develop a mortality risk index for COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this retrospective one-centre cohort study, we included all the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a COVID-19-designated hospital from January 21 to February 5, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and clinical outcome data were collected from the hospital information system, nursing records and laboratory reports. Findings: Of 577 patients with at least one post-admission evaluation, the median age was 55 years (interquartile range [IQR], 39 - 66); 254 (44{$\cdot$}0\%) were men; 22{$\cdot$}8\% (100/438) were severe pneumonia on admission, and 37{$\cdot$}7\% (75/199) patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive. The clinical, laboratory and radiological data were comparable between positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 patients. During a median follow-up of 8{$\cdot$}4 days (IQR, 5{$\cdot$}8 - 12{$\cdot$}0), 39 patients died with a 12-day cumulative mortality of 8{$\cdot$}7\% (95\% CI, 5{$\cdot$}9\% to 11{$\cdot$}5\%). A simple mortality risk index (called ACP index), composed of Age and C-reactive Protein, was developed. By applying the ACP index, patients were categorized into three grades. The 12-day cumulative mortality in grade three (age {$\geq$} 60 years and CRP {$\geq$} 34 mg/L) was 33{$\cdot$}2\% (95\% CI, 19{$\cdot$}8\% to 44{$\cdot$}3\%), which was significantly higher than those of grade two (age {$\geq$} 60 years and CRP {$<$} 34 mg/L; age {$<$} 60 years and CRP {$\geq$} 34 mg/L; 5{$\cdot$}6\% [95\% CI, 0 to 11{$\cdot$}3\%]) and grade one (age {$<$} 60 years and CRP {$<$} 34 mg/L, 0\%) (P {$<$}0{$\cdot$}001), respectively. Interpretation: The ACP index can predict COVID-19 related short-term mortality, which may be a useful and convenient tool for quickly establishing a COVID-19 hierarchical management system that can greatly reduce the medical burden and therefore mortality in highly endemic areas.

  abstract = {Background: With the increasing rate of oral diseases, the global necessity of effective and economical products for its prevention and treatment has intensified. Aim: This study was to compare the effectiveness of two oral hygiene aids: Chewing stick and manual toothbrush, for plaque removal and gingival health after one month of a randomized clinical trial. Materials and Methods: Dental students (age 18-22 years) of a public sector dental hospital were recruited. Sample size was determined using the American Dental Association guidelines. Participants were randomized into two interventional groups and provided with either chewing sticks or toothbrushes. Pre- and post-intervention examinations were executed by two blind and calibrated examiners using plaque and gingival dental indices. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, paired t-test, and two sample independent t-tests. Results: Fifty subjects were recruited with mean age 20 {$\pm$} 0.66 years (80\% were females and 20\% were males). Except for the mean plaque scores of toothbrush users (which increased at post-intervention examination), all other scores showed reduction. In contrast to the final mean gingival scores, a significant difference (P = {$<$} 0.0001) in the final mean plaque score was observed for the two respective interventional groups. Conclusion: Chewing stick has revealed parallel and at times greater mechanical and chemical cleansing of oral tissues as compared to a toothbrush.},

Obese adults were randomly assigned to a LCD (n = 134) or a LFD (n = 136) for 2 years. Cravings for specific types of foods (sweets, high-fats, fast-food fats, and carbohydrates/starches); preferences for high-sugar, high-carbohydrate, and low-carbohydrate/high-protein foods; and appetite were measured during the trial and evaluated during this secondary analysis of trial data. Differences between the LCD and LFD on change in outcome variables were examined with mixed linear models. Compared to the LFD, the LCD had significantly larger decreases in cravings for carbohydrates/starches and preferences for high-carbohydrate and high-sugar foods. The LCD group reported being less bothered by hunger compared to the LFD group. Compared to the LCD group, the LFD group had significantly larger decreases in cravings for high-fat foods and preference for low-carbohydrate/high-protein foods. Men had larger decreases in appetite ratings compared to women. Prescription of diets that promoted restriction of specific types of foods resulted in decreased cravings and preferences for the foods that were targeted for restriction. The results also indicate that the LCD group was less bothered by hunger compared to the LFD group and that men had larger reductions in appetite compared to women.},

Although anaphylaxis may occur after any vaccine, understanding the risk for this outcome, particularly following influenza vaccines, is important because of the large number of persons vaccinated annually. Recent Findings Two recent CDC safety studies confirmed the rarity of post-vaccination anaphylaxis. In a 25-year review of data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), reports in children were most common following childhood vaccinations and among adults more often followed influenza vaccine. In a Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) study, the estimated incidence of anaphylaxis was 1.3 per million vaccine doses administered for all vaccines and 1.6 per million doses for IIV3 (trivalent) influenza vaccine. Summary: Despite its rarity, its rapid onset (usually within minutes) and potentially lethal nature require that all personnel and facilities providing vaccinations have procedures in place for anaphylaxis management.},

  abstract = {Context The present review aimed at reviewing the effects of different statins on lipid profile, particularly in Asians. Evidence Acquisition PubMed searches were conducted using the keywords `statin, effect, and lipid profile' from database inception through March 2016. In this review, 718 articles were retrieved from the primary search. After reviewing the titles, abstracts, and full texts, we found that 59 studies met our inclusion criteria. These also included subsequent reference searches of retrieved articles. Results CURVES study compared the effect on lipid profile between atorvastatin and other statins. This study demonstrated that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TG) were reduced more with atorvastatin compared to simvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin, and fluvastatin. However, simvastatin provided a greater elevation of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) compared to atorvastatin. The STELLAR trial was based on dose-to-dose comparisons between atorvastatin and rosuvastatin efficacy in reducing LDL-C. Te present study also revealed that as the doses of rosuvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin increased, HDL-C also increased, with rosuvastatin having the greatest effect. However, HDL-C levels decreased as the dose of atorvastatin increased. The DISCOVERY study involving the Asian population revealed that the percentage of patients achieving the European goals for LDL-C and TC at 12 weeks was higher in rosuvastatin group compared to atorvastatin group. Conclusions The effects of statins on lipid profile are dose dependent. Most studies showed that rosuvastatin has the best effect on lipid profile. Prescribing lower doses of statins in Asians seems necessary.},

These differences are attributed to differences in cultural norms, mitigation efforts, and health infrastructure. Here we propose that national differences in COVID19 impact could be partially explained by the different national policies respect to Bacillus Calmette-Gu\'erin (BCG) childhood vaccination. BCG vaccination has been reported to offer broad protection to respiratory infections. We compared large number of countries BCG vaccination policies with the morbidity and mortality for COVID-19. We found that countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, Nederland, USA) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies. Countries that have a late start of universal BCG policy (Iran, 1984) had high mortality, consistent with the idea that BCG protects the vaccinated elderly population. We also found that BCG vaccination also reduced the number of reported COVID-19 cases in a country. The combination of reduced morbidity and mortality makes BCG vaccination a potential new tool in the fight against COVID-19.},

Methods We retrospectively report on 1061 SARS-CoV-2 positive tested patients treated for at least three days with the following regimen: HCQ (200~mg three times daily for ten days)~+~AZ (500~mg on day 1 followed by 250~mg daily for the next four days). Outcomes were death, clinical worsening (transfer to ICU, and {$>$}10 day hospitalization) and viral shedding persistence ({$>$}10 days). Results A total of 1061 patients were included in this analysis (46.4\% male, mean age 43.6 years \textendash{} range 14\textendash 95 years). Good clinical outcome and virological cure were obtained in 973 patients within 10 days (91.7\%). Prolonged viral carriage was observed in 47 patients (4.4\%) and was associated to a higher viral load at diagnosis (p~{$<~$}.001) but viral culture was negative at day 10. All but one, were PCR-cleared at day 15. A poor clinical outcome (PClinO) was observed for 46 patients (4.3\%) and 8 died (0.75\%) (74\textendash 95 years old). All deaths resulted from respiratory failure and not from cardiac toxicity. Five patients are still hospitalized (98.7\% of patients cured so far). PClinO was associated with older age (OR 1.11), severity of illness at admission (OR 10.05) and low HCQ serum concentration. PClinO was independently associated with the use of selective beta-blocking agents and angiotensin II receptor blockers (p~{$<~$}.05). A total of 2.3\% of patients reported mild adverse events (gastrointestinal or skin symptoms, headache, insomnia and transient blurred vision). Conclusion Administration of the HCQ+AZ combination before COVID-19 complications occur is safe and associated with a very low fatality rate in patients.},

However, the relative impact of statins on ASCVD outcomes stratified by CAC scores is unknown. Objectives The authors sought to determine whether CAC can identify patients most likely to benefit from statin treatment. Methods The authors identified consecutive subjects without pre-existing ASCVD or malignancy who underwent CAC scoring from 2002 to 2009 at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. The primary outcome was first major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), a composite of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death. The effect of statin therapy on outcomes was analyzed stratified by CAC presence and severity, after adjusting for baseline comorbidities with inverse probability of treatment weights based on propensity scores. Results A total of 13,644 patients (mean age 50 years; 71\% men) were followed for a median of 9.4 years. Comparing patients with and without statin exposure, statin therapy was associated with reduced risk of MACE in patients with CAC (adjusted subhazard ratio: 0.76; 95\% confidence interval: 0.60 to 0.95; p = 0.015), but not in patients without CAC (adjusted subhazard ratio: 1.00; 95\% confidence interval: 0.79 to 1.27; p = 0.99). The effect of statin use on MACE was significantly related to the severity of CAC (p {$<$} 0.0001 for interaction), with the number needed to treat to prevent 1 initial MACE outcome over 10 years ranging from 100 (CAC 1 to 100) to 12 (CAC {$>$}100). Conclusions In a largescale cohort without baseline ASCVD, the presence and severity of CAC identified patients most likely to benefit from statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases.},

  abstract = {Background Current strategies for preventing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections are limited to non-pharmacological interventions. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been proposed as a postexposure therapy to prevent Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) but definitive evidence is lacking. Methods We conducted an open-label, cluster-randomized trial including asymptomatic contacts exposed to a PCR-positive Covid-19 case in Catalonia, Spain. Clusters were randomized to receive no specific therapy (control arm) or HCQ 800mg once, followed by 400mg daily for 6 days (intervention arm). The primary outcome was PCR-confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 within 14 days. The secondary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection, either symptomatically compatible or a PCR-positive result regardless of symptoms. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed up to 28 days. Results The analysis included 2,314 healthy contacts of 672 Covid-19 index cases identified between Mar 17 and Apr 28, 2020. A total of 1,198 were randomly allocated to usual care and 1,116 to HCQ therapy. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 disease (6.2\% usual care vs. 5.7\% HCQ; risk ratio 0.89 [95\% confidence interval 0.54-1.46]), nor evidence of beneficial effects on prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (17.8\% usual care vs. 18.7\% HCQ). The incidence of AEs was higher in the intervention arm than in the control arm (5.9\% usual care vs 51.6\% HCQ), but no treatment-related serious AEs were reported. Conclusions Postexposure therapy with HCQ did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 disease and infection in healthy individuals exposed to a PCR-positive case. Our findings do not support HCQ as postexposure prophylaxis for Covid-19.},

Its main natural sources in foods are vegetables such as onions, the most studied quercetin containing foods, and broccoli; fruits (apples, berry crops, and grapes); some herbs; tea; and wine. Quercetin is known for its antioxidant activity in radical scavenging and anti-allergic properties characterized by stimulation of immune system, antiviral activity, inhibition of histamine release, decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines, leukotrienes creation, and suppresses interleukin IL-4 production. It can improve the Th1/Th2 balance, and restrain antigen-specific IgE antibody formation. It is also effective in the inhibition of enzymes such as lipoxygenase, eosinophil and peroxidase and the suppression of inflammatory mediators. All mentioned mechanisms of action contribute to the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties of quercetin that can be effectively utilized in treatment of late-phase, and late-late-phase bronchial asthma responses, allergic rhinitis and restricted peanut-induced anaphylactic reactions. Plant extract of quercetin is the main ingredient of many potential anti-allergic drugs, supplements and enriched products, which is more competent in inhibiting of IL-8 than cromolyn (anti-allergic drug disodium cromoglycate) and suppresses IL-6 and cytosolic calcium level increase.},

It focuses on drug discovery, drug development, and vaccine technologies based exclusively on messenger RNA (mRNA).Moderna's technology platform inserts synthetic mRNA into human cells. This mRNA then reprograms the cells to prompt immune responses; in conventional medicines, by contrast, immune responses are created externally and injected into the bloodstream. It is a novel technique, previously abandoned due to the side effects of inserting mRNA into cells. As of November 2020, no mRNA drug has ever been approved for use in humans.Moderna has conducted mostly unsuccessful trials in traditional high-margin chronic therapeutic areas with AstraZeneca and in orphan diseases with Alexion Pharmaceuticals. In 2014, Moderna moved to focus on lower-margin vaccines, given that an mRNA vaccine \textendash{} efficacy issues aside \textendash{} will always stimulate a level of antibody development in subjects. The strategic change led industry experts, and Moderna employees, to question the financial viability of the company.In December 2018, Moderna conducted the largest biotech initial public offering (IPO) in history, raising US\$600 million for 8\% of its shares, implying a valuation of \$7.5 billion; from inception to IPO, Moderna reported cumulative losses \$1.5 billion and had raised \$3.2 billion in equity. As of November 2020, Moderna was valued at \$35 billion, and while none of its drugs had been approved, its COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273, was submitted for emergency use authorization.},

Regular physical activity enhances overall sleep quality, but the effects of acute exercise on sleep are not well defined. In sleep hygiene recommendations, intensive exercising is not suggested within the last 3 h before bed time, but this recommendation has not been adequately tested experimentally. Therefore, the effects of vigorous late-night exercise on sleep were examined by measuring polysomnographic, actigraphic and subjective sleep quality, as well as cardiac autonomic activity. Eleven (seven men, four women) physically fit young adults (VO2max 54 {$\pm$} 8 mL{$\cdot$}kg-1{$\cdot$}min-1, age 26 {$\pm$} 3 years) were monitored in a sleep laboratory twice in a counterbalanced order: (1) after vigorous late-night exercise; and (2) after a control day without exercise. The incremental cycle ergometer exercise until voluntary exhaustion started at 21:00 {$\pm$} 00:28 hours, lasted for 35 {$\pm$} 3 min, and ended 2:13 {$\pm$} 00:19 hours before bed time. The proportion of non-rapid eye movement sleep was greater after the exercise day than the control day (P {$<$} 0.01), while no differences were seen in actigraphic or subjective sleep quality.

The results indicate that vigorous late-night exercise does not disturb sleep quality. However, it may have effects on cardiac autonomic control of heart during the first sleeping hours.},

We classified SPTs according to their blood flow pattern on Doppler ultrasound and re-evaluated the efficacy of this imaging modality as a screening method. Additionally, we combined Doppler ultrasound with several values to improve the diagnostic efficacy and to establish a new diagnostic tool. Patients and methods. This study included 189 cases of pathologically confirmed SPTs (122 cases of benign disease including SPTs and tumour-like lesions and 67 cases of malignant SPTs). Ultrasound imaging included evaluation of vascularity by colour Doppler. We established a scoring system to more effectively differentiate malignant from benign SPTs (ultrasound-based sarcoma screening [USS] score). Results. The mean scores in the benign and malignant groups were 1.47 {$\pm$} 0.93 and 3.42 {$\pm$} 1.30, respectively. Patients with malignant masses showed significantly higher USS scores than did those with benign masses (p {$<$} 1 \texttimes{} 10-10). The area under the curve was 0.88 by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Based on the cut-off value (3 points) calculated by ROC curve analysis, the sensitivity and specificity for a diagnosis of malignant SPT was 85.1\% and 86.9\%, respectively. Conclusions. Assessment of vascularity by Doppler ultrasound alone is insufficient for differentiation between benign and malignant SPTs. Preoperative diagnosis of most SPTs is possible by combining our USS score with characteristic clinical and magnetic resonance imaging findings.},

  abstract = {Background Caffeine is one of the most widely consumed pharmacologically active substances. Its acute effect on myocardial blood flow is widely unknown. Our aim was to assess the acute effect of caffeine in a dose corresponding to two cups of coffee on myocardial blood flow (MBF) in coronary artery disease (CAD). Methodology/Principal Findings MBF was measured with 15O-labelled H2O and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) at rest and after supine bicycle exercise in controls (n = 15, mean age 58{$\pm$}13 years) and in CAD patients (n = 15, mean age 61{$\pm$}9 years). In the latter, regional MBF was assessed in segments subtended by stenotic and remote coronary arteries. All measurements were repeated fifty minutes after oral caffeine ingestion (200 mg). Myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) was calculated as ratio of MBF during bicycle stress divided by MBF at rest. Resting MBF was not affected by caffeine in both groups. Exercise-induced MBF response decreased significantly after caffeine in controls (2.26{$\pm$}0.56 vs. 2.02{$\pm$}0.56, P{$<$}0.005), remote (2.40{$\pm$}0.70 vs. 1.78{$\pm$}0.46, P{$<$}0.001) and in stenotic segments (1.90{$\pm$}0.41 vs. 1.38{$\pm$}0.30, P{$<$}0.001). Caffeine decreased MPR significantly by 14\% in controls (P{$<$}0.05 vs. baseline). In CAD patients MPR decreased by 18\% (P{$<$}0.05 vs. baseline) in remote and by 25\% in stenotic segments (P{$<$}0.01 vs. baseline). Conclusions We conclude that caffeine impairs exercise-induced hyperaemic MBF response in patients with CAD to a greater degree than age-matched controls.},

  abstract = {Most individuals adjust their caffeine intake according to the objective and subjective effects induced by the methylxanthine. However, to reach the desired effects, the quantity of caffeine consumed varies largely among individuals. It has been known for decades that the metabolism, clearance, and pharmacokinetics of caffeine is affected by many factors such as age, sex and hormones, liver disease, obesity, smoking, and diet. Caffeine also interacts with many medications. All these factors will be reviewed in the present document and discussed in light of the most recent data concerning the genetic variability affecting caffeine levels and effects at the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic levels that both critically drive the level of caffeine consumption. The pharmacokinetics of caffeine are highly variable among individuals due to a polymorphism at the level of the CYP1A2 isoform of cytochrome P450, which metabolizes 95\% of the caffeine ingested. Moreover there is a polymorphism at the level of another critical enzyme, N-acetyltransferase 2. At the pharmacodynamic level, there are several polymorphisms at the main brain target of caffeine, the adenosine A2A receptor or ADORA2. Genetic studies, including genome-wide association studies, identified several loci critically involved in caffeine consumption and its consequences on sleep, anxiety, and potentially in neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. We start reaching a better picture on how a multiplicity of biologic mechanisms seems to drive the levels of caffeine consumption, although much more knowledge is still required to understand caffeine consumption and effects on body functions.},

  abstract = {Aims The aims of the study were, first, to critically evaluate lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] as a cardiovascular risk factor and, second, to advise on screening for elevated plasma Lp(a), on desirable levels, and on therapeutic strategies. Methods and results The robust and specific association between elevated Lp(a) levels and increased cardiovascular disease (CVD)/coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, together with recent genetic findings, indicates that elevated Lp(a), like elevated LDL-cholesterol, is causally related to premature CVD/CHD. The association is continuous without a threshold or dependence on LDL- or non-HDL-cholesterol levels. Mechanistically, elevated Lp(a) levels may either induce a prothrombotic/anti-fibrinolytic effect as apolipoprotein(a) resembles both plasminogen and plasmin but has no fibrinolytic activity, or may accelerate atherosclerosis because, like LDL, the Lp(a) particle is cholesterol-rich, or both. We advise that Lp(a) be measured once, using an isoform-insensitive assay, in subjects at intermediate or high CVD/CHD risk with premature CVD, familial hypercholesterolaemia, a family history of premature CVD and/or elevated Lp(a), recurrent CVD despite statin treatment, {$\geq$}3\% 10-year risk of fatal CVD according to European guidelines, and/or {$\geq$}10\% 10-year risk of fatal + non-fatal CHD according to US guidelines. As a secondary priority after LDL-cholesterol reduction, we recommend a desirable level for Lp(a) {$<$}80th percentile (less than {$\sim$}50 mg/dL). Treatment should primarily be niacin 1\textendash 3 g/day, as a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled intervention trials demonstrates reduced CVD by niacin treatment. In extreme cases, LDL-apheresis is efficacious in removing Lp(a). Conclusion We recommend screening for elevated Lp(a) in those at intermediate or high CVD/CHD risk, a desirable level {$<$}50 mg/dL as a function of global cardiovascular risk, and use of niacin for Lp(a) and CVD/CHD risk reduction.},

  abstract = {The response of cerebral vasculature to exercise is different from other peripheral vasculature; it has a small vascular bed and is strongly regulated by cerebral autoregulation and the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2). In contrast to other organs, the traditional thinking is that total cerebral blood flow (CBF) remains relatively constant and is largely unaffected by a variety of conditions, including those imposed during exercise. Recent research, however, indicates that cerebral neuronal activity and metabolism drive an increase in CBF during exercise. Increases in exercise intensity up to {$\sim$}60\% of maximal oxygen uptake produce elevations in CBF, after which CBF decreases toward baseline values because of lower PaCO2 via hyperventilation-induced cerebral vasoconstriction. This finding indicates that, during heavy exercise, CBF decreases despite the cerebral metabolic demand. In contrast, this reduced CBF during heavy exercise lowers cerebral oxygenation and therefore may act as an independent influence on central fatigue. In this review, we highlight methodological considerations relevant for the assessment of CBF and then summarize the integrative mechanisms underlying the regulation of CBF at rest and during exercise. In addition, we examine how CBF regulation during exercise is altered by exercise training, hypoxia, and aging and suggest avenues for future research.},

To determine the mechanism by which vitamin D deficiency mediates accelerated cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes, we investigated the effects of active vitamin D on macrophage cholesterol deposition. Methods and Results We obtained macrophages from 76 obese, diabetic, hypertensive patients with vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D {$<$} 80 nmol/L)(group A) and four control groups: obese, diabetic, hypertensive patients with normal vitamin D (group B, n=15), obese, non-diabetic, hypertensive patients with vitamin D deficiency (group C, n=25), and non-obese, non-diabetic, non-hypertensive patients with vitamin D deficiency (group D, n=10) or sufficiency (group E, n=10). The same patient's macrophages from all groups were cultured in vitamin D-deficient or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) supplemented media and exposed to modified low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. 1,25(OH)2D3 suppressed foam cell formation by reducing acetylated or oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol uptake in diabetics only. Conversely, deletion of the vitamin D receptor in macrophages from diabetic patients accelerated foam-cell formation induced by modified LDL. 1,25(OH)2D3 downregulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation reduced PPAR{$\gamma$} expression, suppressed CD36 expression, and prevented oxLDL-derived cholesterol uptake. In addition, 1,25(OH)2D3 suppression of macrophage endoplasmic reticulum stress improved insulin signaling, downregulated SR-A1expression, and prevented oxLDL and AcLDL-derived cholesterol uptake. Conclusion These results identify reduced vitamin D receptor signaling as a potential mechanism underlying increased foam-cell formation and accelerated cardiovascular disease in diabetics.},

The body temperature in the mice administered capsiate was higher than in the mice administered the vehicle. Furthermore, we injected capsazepine, a specific antagonist of vanilloid receptors, into the peritoneal cavity and orally administered capsiate via a stomach tube to mice. The body temperature in the mice pretreated with capsazepine was lower than in the mice injected with the vehicle.

  abstract = {The thermal environment is one of the most important factors that can affect human sleep. The stereotypical effects of heat or cold exposure are increased wakefulness and decreased rapid eye movement sleep and slow wave sleep. These effects of the thermal environment on sleep stages are strongly linked to thermoregulation, which affects the mechanism regulating sleep. The effects on sleep stages also differ depending on the use of bedding and/or clothing. In semi-nude subjects, sleep stages are more affected by cold exposure than heat exposure. In real-life situations where bedding and clothing are used, heat exposure increases wakefulness and decreases slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep. Humid heat exposure further increases thermal load during sleep and affects sleep stages and thermoregulation. On the other hand, cold exposure does not affect sleep stages, though the use of beddings and clothing during sleep is critical in supporting thermoregulation and sleep in cold exposure. However, cold exposure affects cardiac autonomic response during sleep without affecting sleep stages and subjective sensations. These results indicate that the impact of cold exposure may be greater than that of heat exposure in real-life situations; thus, further studies are warranted that consider the effect of cold exposure on sleep and other physiological parameters.},

  abstract = {Military personnel experience energy deficit (total energy expenditure higher than energy intake), particularly during combat training and field exercises where exercising energy expenditures are high and energy intake is reduced. Low energy availability (energy intake minus exercising energy expenditure expressed relative to fat free mass) impairs endocrine function and bone health, as recognized in female athletes as the Female Athlete Triad syndrome. More recently, the Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S) syndrome encompasses broader health outcomes, physical and cognitive performance, non-athletes, and men. This review summarizes the evidence for the effect of low energy availability and energy deficiency in military training and operations on health and performance outcomes. Energy availability is difficult to measure in free-living individuals but doubly labeled water studies demonstrate high total energy expenditures during military training; studies that have concurrently measured energy intake, or measured body composition changes with DXA, suggest severe and/or prolonged energy deficits. Military training in energy deficit disturbs endocrine and metabolic function, menstrual function, bone health, immune function, gastrointestinal health, iron status, mood, and physical and cognitive performance. There are more data for men than women, and little evidence on the chronic effects of repeated exposures to energy deficit. Military training impairs indices of health and performance, indicative of the Triad and RED-S, but the multi-stressor environment makes it difficult to isolate the independent effects of energy deficiency. Studies supplementing with energy to attenuate the energy deficit suggest an independent effect of energy deficiency in the disturbances to metabolic, endocrine and immune function, and physical performance, but randomized controlled trials are lacking.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h2{$><$}p{$>$}\textbf{Background:} Food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis is a severe form of allergy; the reaction is caused by ingestion of a specific food before exercise. This disorder often escapes diagnosis because neither the ingested food nor the exercise alone induces the symptoms. \textbf{Objective:} The aim of the study was to characterize the allergens involved in wheat-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis and to describe the clinical outcome in a series of 18 adult patients. \textbf{Methods:} All 18 patients had experienced recurrent episodes of generalized urticaria during exercise, 17 patients in association with collapse and 15 patients with an anaphylactic reaction. The symptoms appeared only when the patients had eaten food containing wheat before exercise. Wheat allergens were detected by immunoblotting, purified by gel filtration and reversed-phase chromatography, and subjected to N-terminal sequencing. The IgE-binding ability of the purified proteins was studied by ELISA, and their in vivo reactivity was studied by skin prick testing. \textbf{Results:} IgE antibodies from pooled patient sera were bound to 65-kd and 40-kd wheat proteins in immunoblotting. The 65-kd allergen was a previously undescribed wheat protein, showing 61\% sequence identity to {$\gamma$}-gliadin, whereas the 40-kd allergen had 100\% identity to {$\alpha$}-gliadin. In ELISA, all 18 patients showed elevated IgE levels to the novel {$\gamma$}-like gliadin, and 13 of the patients showed elevated IgE levels to the {$\alpha$}-gliadin. None of the 54 control subjects with wheat allergy, urticaria, or coeliac disease had IgE antibodies to the {$\gamma$}-like gliadin. The in vivo reactivity of the {$\gamma$}-like gliadin was verified by positive skin prick test responses in all of the 15 patients who were tested. During the follow-up on a gluten-free or wheat-free diet, 3 patients experienced reactions after having unknowingly eaten wheat before exercise, but all the other patients who were adhering to the diet remained symptom-free. \textbf{Conclusion:} This study shows that wheat is a frequent cause of food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis and suggests that the major allergen is a previously undescribed {$\gamma$}-like gliadin. For screening of this life-threatening allergy, we recommend skin prick testing with crude gliadin and we recommend a gluten-free diet for treatment.

  abstract = {Coronaviruses are positive strand RNA viruses that cause disease in humans, and domestic and companion animals. They are most notorious for causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks in 2002\textendash 2003. All coronaviruses follow the same basic strategy of replication.All coronaviruses encode 15 or 16 replicase related proteins, 4 or 5 structural proteins and 1\textendash 8 group-specific or accessory proteins. Many of the replicase proteins are assembled into replication machinery in double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and on a reticular network of membranes that are derived from the endoplasmic reticulum.Coronaviruses are readily transmitted across species. This phenomenon was illustrated when the SARS-coronavirus crossed species from bats to intermediate hosts, such as palm civets, and then to humans. It also explains the large number of species, including humans, that are infected with viruses closely related to bovine coronavirus.In many coronavirus infections, disease severity increases during virus clearance, suggesting that the host immune response is both protective and pathogenic. Furthermore, inhibition of specific aspects of the immune response results in less severe disease and less tissue destruction, without diminishing the kinetics of virus clearance.Like all successful viruses, coronaviruses have evolved both passive and active mechanisms to evade the interferon response. Replication in DMVs may contribute to passive evasion of the innate immune response by making double-stranded RNA inaccessible to cellular sensors. , Coronaviruses gained prominence during the SARS outbreaks of 2002\textendash 2003, but there are many different coronaviruses that infect humans and animals. Perlman and Netland describe the biology of the coronaviruses, including their replication, host immune response and interspecies transmission., Although coronaviruses were first identified nearly 60 years ago, they only received notoriety in 2003 when one of their members was identified as the aetiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Previously these viruses were known to be important agents of respiratory and enteric infections of domestic and companion animals and to cause approximately 15\% of all cases of the common cold. This Review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of coronavirus replication, interactions with the host immune response and disease pathogenesis. It also highlights the recent identification of numerous novel coronaviruses and the propensity of this virus family to cross species barriers.},

We examined the effect of VM intensity and duration on middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv) responses. Healthy men (n = 10; mean {$\pm$} SD: 26 {$\pm$} 4 years) completed 30\%, 60\%, and 90\% of their maximal VM mouth pressure, for 5 and 10 sec (order randomized) while standing. Beat-to-beat MCAv and MAP during phase I (peak), at nadir (phase III), and recovery are reported as the change from standing baseline. During phase I, MCAv rose 15 {$\pm$} 6 cm{$\cdot$}s-1 (P {$<$} 0.001), which was not reliably different between intensities (P = 0.11), despite graded increases in MAP (P {$<$} 0.001; e.g., +12 {$\pm$} 9 mmHg vs. +35 {$\pm$} 14 for 5 sec 30\% and 90\% VM, respectively). During Phase III, the MCAv response was duration- (P = 0.045) and intensity dependent (P {$<$} 0.001), with the largest decrease observed following the 90\% VM (e.g., -19 {$\pm$} 13 and -15 {$\pm$} 11 cm{$\cdot$}s-1 for 5 and 10 sec VM, respectively) with a concomitant decrease in MAP (P {$<$} 0.001, -23 {$\pm$} 11 and -23 {$\pm$} 9 mmHg). This asymmetric response may be attributable to the differential modulators of MCAv throughout the VM. The mechanical effects of the elevated intrathoracic pressure during phase I may restrain increases in cerebral perfusion via related increases in intracranial pressure; however, during phase III the decrease in MCAv arises from an abrupt hypotension, the extent of which is dependent upon both the duration and intensity of the VM.},

Only English-language articles published up until February 27, 2013, were considered.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Results{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}MMAS has been diagnosed in patients with systemic reactions to hymenoptera stings and elevated baseline serum tryptase as well as in patients with unexplained episodes of anaphylaxis. A bone marrow biopsy establishes the diagnosis by revealing the presence of monoclonal mast cells that carry the D816V \emph{KIT} mutation and/or express CD25 while the diagnostic requirements for systemic mastocytosis are not met. MCAS affects predominantly women in whom no mast cell abnormality or external triggers account for their episodes of mast cell activation. MCAS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and primary and secondary mast cell activation disorders as well as idiopathic anaphylaxis have to be ruled out before making the diagnosis. Patients with MCAS and MMAS are treated in a stepwise fashion with drugs that block the effects of mediators released by mast cells on activation. One third of MCAS patients experience complete resolution of symptoms with treatment, while one third have a major response and one third a minor response to treatment. A combination of drugs is usually necessary to achieve symptom control. No drug trial has been performed in patients with MMAS and MCAS.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Conclusions{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}MMAS and MCAS are 2 newly described, rare syndromes of mast cell activation. Further studies will be necessary to better understand the cause of these conditions and their natural evolution and to validate and improve the treatment approach. Research should also focus on developing drugs with the potential to cure these debilitating disorders. To achieve these goals, centers with expertise in mast cell activation disorders are essential as they allow for a critical mass of these patients to be enrolled in studies while providing those patients with the most up-to-date diagnostic procedures and treatment strategies.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Exercise-induced anaphylaxis (EIAn) is defined as the occurrence of anaphylactic symptoms (skin, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular symptoms) after physical activity. In about a third of cases, cofactors, such as food intake, temperature (warm or cold), and drugs (especially nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) can be identified. When the associated cofactor is food ingestion, the correct diagnosis is food-dependent EIAn (FDEIAn). The literature describes numerous reports of FDEIAn after intake of very different foods, from vegetables and nuts to meats and seafood. One of the best-characterized types of FDEIAn is that due to {$\omega$}5-gliadin of wheat, though cases of FDEIAn after wheat ingestion by sensitization to wheat lipid transfer protien (LTP) are described. Some pathophysiological mechanisms underlying EIAn have been hypothesized, such as increase/alteration in gastrointestinal permeability, alteration of tissue transglutaminase promoting IgE cross-linking, enhanced expression of cytokines, redistribution of blood during physical exercise leading to altered mast-cell degranulation, and also changes in the acid\textendash base balance. Nevertheless, until now, none of these hypotheses has been validated. The diagnosis of EIAn and FDEIAn is achieved by means of a challenge, with physical exercise alone for EIAn, and with the assumption of the suspected food followed by physical exercise for FDEIAn; in cases of doubtful results, a double-blind placebo-controlled combined food\textendash exercise challenge should be performed. The prevention of this particular kind of anaphylaxis is the avoidance of the specific trigger, ie, physical exercise for EIAn, the assumption of the culprit food before exercise for FDEIAn, and in general the avoidance of the recognized cofactors. Patients must be supplied with an epinephrine autoinjector, as epinephrine has been clearly recognized as the first-line intervention for anaphylaxis.},

This review focuses on the differential diagnosis and workup of patients presenting with transient vision loss, focusing on several key areas: the relationship to thromboembolic vascular disease, hypercoagulable testing, retinal migraine, and bilateral vision loss. The objective is to provide the ophthalmologist with information on how to best manage these patients. Thromboembolic etiologies for transient vision loss are sometimes managed with medications, but when carotid surgery is indicated, earlier intervention may prevent future stroke. This need for early treatment places the ophthalmologist in the important role of expediting the management process. Hospital admission is recommended in patients presenting with transient symptoms within 72 hours who meet certain high-risk criteria. When the cause is giant cell arteritis, ocular ischemic syndrome, or a cardioembolic source, early management of the underlying condition is equally important. For nonthromboembolic causes of transient vision loss such as retinal migraine or retinal vasospasm, the ophthalmologist can provide reassurance as well as potentially give medications to decrease the frequency of vision loss episodes.},

  abstract = {The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak from December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, has been declared a global public health emergency. Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by SARS-CoV-2 to infect human cells. Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. SARS-CoV-2 may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119~cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs. We also conducted ``CellPhoneDB'' analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues. We found that macrophages frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense and immune pathogenesis.},

OBSERVATIONS: I report 23 otherwise healthy patients (22 females, 1 male) who developed EIV after walking or hiking in hot weather. Erythematous, urticarial or purpuric plaques arose on the lower legs, not involving skin compressed by socks. Symptoms included itch, pain, and burning sensation. Lesions resolved after some days. Relapses were frequent at further muscular exercise, and could be prevented in some cases by compression hosiery, manual lymphatic drainage, intake of oedema protective agents, or steroids (local or systemic). INVESTIGATIONS: Histopathology demonstrated leucocytoclastic vasculitis in five biopsies, and urticarial vasculitis in one. Extensive blood investigations have been performed in six patients and were negative. No clear relation with chronic venous disease (duplex or Doppler) had been established in 12 patients. CONCLUSIONS: I suggest denominating this condition exercise-induced vasculitis. This clinical entity is well defined, but poorly recognized. The presentation of 23 original cases demonstrates its reality.},

Early recognition of medical emergencies begins at the first sign of symptoms. The basic algorithm for management of all medical emergencies is this: position (P), airway (A), breathing (B), circulation (C) and definitive treatment, differential diagnosis, drugs, defibrillation (D). The dentist places an unconscious patient in a supine position and comfortably positions a conscious patient. The dentist then assesses airway, breathing and circulation and, when necessary, supports the patient's vital functions. Drug therapy always is secondary to basic life support (that is, PABCD). Conclusions and Clinical Implications. Prompt recognition and efficient management of medical emergencies by a well-prepared dental team can increase the likelihood of a satisfactory outcome. The basic algorithm for managing medical emergencies is designed to ensure that the patient's brain receives a constant supply of blood containing oxygen.},

  abstract = {Male rabbits were fed for 6 months a purified diet rich in fat (45\% of calories), mostly saturated (butter) containing per 100 g either 354 mg of calcium and 46 mg of magnesium (group I), 948 mg of calcium and 46 mg of magnesium (group II), or 354 mg of calcium and 356 mg of magnesium (group III). In group II, fed the additional calcium, significant (P {$<$} 0.001) changes were observed; i.e. prolongation of clotting time (platelet clotting activity), decrease in platelet aggregation to thrombin, and in the concentration of the plasma total cholesterol, with a less significant (P {$<$} 0.05) decrease in plasma triglycerides. A significant (P {$<$} 0.01) decrease in the ratio monoemes/ 18:2 in the plasma cholesterol esters but not in the plasma or platelet phospholipids was also found in these rabbits. In relation to their lower activity, platelets from group II exhibited a significant increase in 22:4n-6 (phospholipids) and in the ratio cholesterol/phospholipids, both significantly correlated with the platelet function tests. In this same group, the excretion of fecal lipids and saturated fatty acid 18:0 was increased by 4.3-fold and 7.6-fold, respectively. The severity of atherosclerosis and the accumulation of cholesterol in the aorta were significantly lower in group II, while the plasma level of calcium was similar to that of group I. In group III, fed additional magnesium, results were similar to those of group II, but less significant. It seems that calcium (and magnesium) markedly decreased the atherogenicity of saturated fats by promoting their fecal excretion, thus decreasing their untoward effects on serum lipids and platelet functions. These results may be related to the known protective effect of hard water on coronary heart disease.},

In type 2 diabetics, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is 20\% higher than in non-diabetics, and low vitamin D levels nearly double the relative risk of developing CVD compared to diabetic patients with normal vitamin D levels. However, the mechanism(s) by which vitamin D deficiency leads to an increased susceptibility to atherosclerosis in these patients is unknown. We studied the effects of vitamin D replacement on macrophage cholesterol metabolism and foam cell formation in obese, hypertensive diabetics and non-diabetic controls. We found that 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] suppressed foam cell formation by reducing acetylated low density lipoprotein (AcLDL) and oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) cholesterol uptake in diabetics only. 1,25(OH)2D3 downregulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation reduced PPARgamma and CD36 expression, and prevented oxLDL-derived cholesterol uptake. In addition, 1,25(OH)2D3 suppression of macrophage endoplasmic reticulum stress improved insulin signaling, downregulated SR-A1 expression, and prevented oxLDL- and AcLDL-derived cholesterol uptake. The results of this research reveal novel insights into the mechanisms linking vitamin D signaling to foam cell formation in diabetics and suggest a potential new therapeutic target to reduce cardiovascular risk in this population.},

  abstract = {The metabolism of cholesterol and its 5-dihydro derivative, cholestanol, was investigated by means of sterol balance and isotope kinetic techniques in 3 subjects with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) and 11 other individuals. All subjects were hospitalized on a metabolic ward and were fed diets practically free of cholesterol and cholestanol. After the intravenous administration of [1,2-3H]cholestanol, the radioactive sterol was transported and esterified in plasma lipoproteins in an identical manner to cholesterol. In these short-term experiments, the specific activity-time curves of plasma cholestanol conformed to two-pool models in both the CTX and control groups. However, cholestanol plasma concentrations, total body miscible pools, and daily synthesis rates were two to five times greater in the CTX than control individuals. The short-term specific activity decay curves of plasma [4-14C]cholesterol also conformed to two-pool models in both groups. However, in the CTX subjects the decay was more rapid, and daily cholesterol synthesis was nearly double that of the control subjects. Plasma concentrations and the sizes of the rapidly turning over pool of exchangeable cholesterol were apparently small in the CTX subjects, and these measurements did not correlate with the large cholesterol deposits found in tendon and tuberous xanthomas., Despite active cholesterol synthesis, bile acid formation was subnormal in the CTX subjects. However, bile acid sequestration was accompanied by a rise in plasma cholestanol levels and greatly augmented fecal cholestanol outputs. In contrast, the administration of clofibrate lowered plasma cholesterol levels 50\% and presumably reduced synthesis in the CTX subjects. Plasma cholesterol concentrations and fecal steroid excretion did not change significantly during this therapy., These findings indicate that the excessive tissue deposits of cholesterol and cholestanol that characterize CTX were associated with hyperactive neutral sterol synthesis. The demonstration of subnormal bile acid formation suggests that defective bile acid synthesis may predispose to the neutral sterol abnormalities.},

  abstract = {In December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus firstly emerged in Wuhan, China and then spread rapidly worldwide to be declared as a pandemic by WHO in March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 virus, showed preferential age groups selection, age and in contrary with the infected adults, most infected children seemed to have a milder clinical course. Also, asymptomatic infections were not uncommon. We suppose that the global routine immunization of children could play a role in protection of the pediatric age form the devastating effect of SARS-CoV-2. MMR, BCG, PPD, and Candida vaccines are already used as treatment options enhancing the ability of the immune system to recognize certain viral antigen. Overall, we suggest that the bystander immunity induced after vaccination of children from 1-8 years old can stimulate the immunity against SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therefore, we recommend assessing the use of one or combined vaccination of MMR, BCG, PPD, and Candida to either protect the high-risk groups or to treat the emerging pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 virus and the associated serious complication of COVID-19.},

An awareness of amine levels in foods today is therefore important in relation to food safety and patient care. This review aims to emphasise the need to unify the information on the content of biogenic amines in foods and prevent patients' misunderstanding. Methods: Selective literature search for relevant publications in PubMed and other scientific data bases combined with further data from the World Wide Web on histamine and other amines content in foods. Results: Available reference sources do not reflect a homogeneous consensus, and the variation between foods makes it impossible for dieticians to accurately estimate amines content to correctly advise patients. Conclusions: To achieve the goal of collecting reliable information, all methods and tools used in analytical studies should be standardised and information exposed to patients should be verified.},

  abstract = {Lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) is recognised as a risk factor for arterial and venous thrombosis, a property which may relate to its structural similarity to plasminogen. Pregnancy is associated with a hypofibrinolytic state. Elevated Lp(a) may influence fibrinolysis and have an unfavourable role in pregnancy outcome. In this study alterations in plasma Lp(a) concentrations during normal pregnancy was examined, in a detailed longitudinal investigation, in ten women together with changes in other lipid parameters. In addition, Lp(a) concentrations were examined in subjects with pre-eclampsia (n=10) relative to matched controls (n=10), since it has recently been reported that a substantial increase in circulating Lp(a) occurs in this disorder. Lp(a) concentration increased steadily in normal pregnancy between 10 and 35 weeks with a doubling of the median value from 14.5 to 27.0 mg/dl (P=0.01). A significant increase in Lp(a) values was observed in all subjects with increasing gestation (median rise 190\%, range 117-340\%). This increase was intermediate to those seen in plasma triglyceride and cholesterol. No significant difference in Lp(a) values was observed in subjects with pre-eclampsia, compared with matched normal pregnancy controls (median 14 mg/dl [IQR 4.7-69.0] in pre-eclampsia vs 20 mg/dl [9.0-56. 3] in controls; P=0.57), at a median gestation of 32 weeks. In conclusion, there is a 2-fold increase in Lp(a) during normal pregnancy, which may influence fibrinolysis. Circulating Lp(a) is not significantly elevated in women with pre-eclampsia, and thus is unlikely to play a role in the pathophysiology of this disorder.},

Asthma attacks, cholinergic urticaria and angioedema, and cardiac arrythmias are recognized as exertion-related phenomena in predisposed patients but are distinct from the syndrome described here. A syndrome characterized by the exertion-related onset of cutaneous pruritus and warmth, the development of generalized urticaria, and the appearance of such additional manifestations as collapse in 12 patients, gastrointestinal tract symptoms in five patients, and upper respiratory distress in 10 patients has been designated exercise-induced anaphylaxis, because of the striking similarity of this symptom complex to the anaphylactic syndrome elicited by ingestion or injection of a foreign antigenic substance. There is a family history of atopic disease for 11 patients and cold urticaria for two others and a personal history of atopy in six. The size of the wheals, the failure to develop an attack with a warm bath or shower or a fever, and the prominence of syncope rule against the diagnosis of conventional cholinergic urticaria. There is no history or evidence of an encounter with an environmental source of antigen during the exercise period.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The autonomic (including sudomotor, baroreceptor, and vasomotor) functions were assessed in 3 groups of individuals, comprising normal, hyperhidrotic, and denervated subjects. The normal group had no palmar hyperhidrosis, with intact T2-3 ganglia, the hyperhidrotic group had palmar hyperhidrosis with intact T2-3 ganglia, and the denervated group had palmar hyperhidrosis treated with T2-3 ganglionectomy. Compared with both the normal and hyperhidrotic subjects, the denervated subjects had a much smaller sweating response of both the forehead, the upper chest region and the upper extremities, and a much greater sweating response of both the lateral lumbar and ventral thigh regions in response to body exercise. In addition, cardiovascular responses to either the Valsalva manoeuver, face immersion, or finger immersion were evaluated in these groups of subjects. When compared with those of either the normal or the denervated subjects, the hyperhidrotic subjects had less reflex bradycardia in response to either Valsalva manoeuver or face immersion. In contrast, when compared with those of either the normal or the denervated subjects, the hyperhidrotic subjects had a higher degree of cutaneous vasoconstriction in response to finger (or cold) immersion. The data indicate that the sympathetic fibers passing through the T2-3 ganglia play an important role in the elaboration or modulation of autonomic function elsewhere. Probably, the hyperhidrotic subjects have an over-functioning of the sympathetic nervous fibers which pass through the T2-3 ganglia, which leads to autonomic dysfunction. The autonomic dysfunctions observed in the hyperhidrotic subjects could be eliminated after the interruption of the excessive sympathetic activities passing through the T2-3 ganglia level.

  abstract = {Despite a growing body of research on the consequences of procrastination for health and well-being, there is little research focused on testing or explaining the potential links between procrastination and sleep quality. Using the procrastination\textendash health model as our guiding conceptual lens, we addressed this gap by examining how and why trait procrastination may be linked to various dimensions of sleep quality across two student samples. In Study 1, procrastination was associated with feeling unrested, but not with sleep disturbance frequency, in a sample of Greek undergraduate students (N = 141). In Study 2, bootstrapping analysis of the indirect effects of procrastination on an index of sleep quality through perceived stress in a sample of Canadian students (N = 339) was significant, supporting an extended procrastination\textendash health model view of how chronic self-regulation failure may compromise sleep quality. Given the potential for dynamic and reciprocal relations among procrastination, stress, and sleep quality, suggested by the current and other research, the ways in which procrastination may contribute to and be influenced by poor sleep quality warrant further investigation.},

  abstract = {Complications of atherosclerosis are the most common cause of death in Western societies1. Among the many risk factors identified by epidemiological studies, only elevated levels of lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein (apo) B can drive the development of atherosclerosis in humans and experimental animals even in the absence of other risk factors2. However, the mechanisms that lead to atherosclerosis are still poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that the subendothelial retention of atherogenic apoB-containing lipoproteins is the initiating event in atherogenesis3. The extracellular matrix of the subendothelium, particularly proteoglycans, is thought to play a major role in the retention of atherogenic lipoproteins4. The interaction between atherogenic lipoproteins and proteoglycans involves an ionic interaction between basic amino acids in apoB100 and negatively charged sulphate groups on the proteoglycans5. Here we present direct experimental evidence that the atherogenicity of apoB-containing low-density lipoproteins (LDL) is linked to their affinity for artery wall proteoglycans. Mice expressing proteoglycan-binding-defective LDL developed significantly less atherosclerosis than mice expressing wild-type control LDL. We conclude that subendothelial retention of apoB100-containing lipoprotein is an early step in atherogenesis.},

In 10\%, pain was experienced in the neck with the initial typical orbitotemporal pain; in 37\%, pain radiated from the orbit or temple to the ipsilateral side of the neck. Sometimes, neck pain heralded the onset of the attack by a few minutes. During an attack, neck stiffness was reported in 40\% and tenderness in 29\%. Movement of the neck, especially flexion, precipitated cluster headache in 9\% of patients. This was particularly true of patients with chronic cluster headache. Neck movement aggravated the headache in 16 of 100 patients and an equal number reported amelioration of pain by neck movement, especially extension. The nuchal features did not necessarily accompany every attack and were usually overshadowed by the severity of the typical headache. Nevertheless, symptoms referable to the neck occur more commonly than is generally appreciated.},

  abstract = {Background Removal of the appendix might induce physiological changes in the gastrointestinal tract, and subsequently play a role in carcinogenesis. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide register-based cohort study in Sweden to investigate whether appendectomy is associated with altered risks of gastrointestinal cancers. Methods A population-based cohort study was conducted using the Swedish national registries, including 480,382 eligible patients followed during the period of 1970\textendash 2009 for the occurrence of site-specific gastrointestinal cancer (esophageal/gastric/colon/rectal cancer). Outcome and censoring information was collected by linkage to health and demography registers. We examined the incidence of appendectomy in Sweden using data from 1987\textendash 2009. We also calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) to estimate the relative gastrointestinal cancer risk through comparison to the general population. Results We noted an overall decrease in the age-standardized incidence of appendectomy among the entire Swedish population from 189.3 to 105.6 per 100,000 individuals between 1987 and 2009. Grouped by different discharge diagnosis, acute appendicitis, incidental appendectomy, and entirely negative appendectomy continuously decreased over the study period, while the perforation ratio (18\%\textendash 23\%) stayed relatively constant. Compared to the general population, no excess cancer risk was observed for gastrointestinal cancers under study with the exception of a marginally elevated risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma (SIR 1.32, 95\% CI 1.09\textendash 1.58). Conclusions In Sweden, the incidence of appendectomy and acute appendicitis has decreased during 1987\textendash 2009. No excess gastrointestinal cancer risks were observed among these appendectomized patients, with the possible exception of esophageal adenocarcinoma.},

The evaluation typically consists of a thorough history and physical examination as well as endocrinological and radiological investigations. FHA, if prolonged, can have significant impacts on metabolic, bone, cardiovascular, mental, and reproductive health. Management often involves a multidisciplinary approach, with a focus on lifestyle modification. Depending on the severity, pharmacologic therapy may also be considered.

Thirteen CrossFit-trained men (age = 28.5 \&plusmn; 6.6 years, experience = 49.2 \&plusmn; 36.3 months) were randomized in a double-blind, crossover design. Participants completed two sessions separated by a seven-day washout period, 60 min after consuming 5 mg/kg body mass of caffeine or a placebo. In each session, participants completed as many rounds as possible in 20 min of 5 pull-ups, 10 push-ups, and 15 air squats. CrossFit performance was the total number of repetitions completed in 20 min. Paired samples t-tests were used to compare CrossFit performance between caffeine and placebo conditions and to test for a potential learning effect between the first and second sessions. CrossFit performance was significantly higher during the caffeine condition compared to the placebo (461.4 \&plusmn; 103 vs. 425.0 \&plusmn; 93.5 repetitions, p \&lt; 0.05). No significant learning effect was identified between the first and second sessions (445.6 \&plusmn; 95.0 vs. 440.8 \&plusmn; 105.0 repetitions, p = 0.73) nor was there a significant treatment order effect (p = 0.40).

Nevertheless, there is growing evidence that key gene variants can alter activity within specific neuronal circuits and, therefore, influence particular cognitive-affective phenomena. One example is the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene, which has a common variant at codon 158. Those with valine (Val158) alleles have increased greater COMT activity and lower prefrontal extracellular dopamine compared with those with the methionine (Met158) substitution. Val158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in the processing of aversive stimuli (warrior strategy), while Met158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in memory and attention tasks (worrier strategy). Under conditions of increased dopamine release (eg, stress), individuals with Val158 alleles may have improved dopaminergic transmission and better performance, while individuals with Met158 alleles may have less efficient neurotransmission and worse performance. Some evidence suggests that Val158 alleles are associated with schizophrenia, while Met158 alleles are associated with anxiety.},

Facts showed: (i) normal tunica intima invariably consists of multiple cellular layers; and (ii) initial lipid depositions occurred in the deepest layers of tunica intima.

To assess the clinical significance of modest elevations in serum DHT and the DHT/testosterone (T) ratio observed in response to common T replacement therapy, a comprehensive review of the published literature was performed to identify relevant data. Although the primary focus of this review is about DHT in men, we also provide a brief overview of DHT in women. The available published data are limited by the lack of large, well-controlled studies of long duration that are sufficiently powered to expose subtle safety signals. Nonetheless, the preponderance of available clinical data indicates that modest elevations in circulating levels of DHT in response to androgen therapy should not be of concern in clinical practice. Elevated DHT has not been associated with increased risk of prostate disease (e.g., cancer or benign hyperplasia) nor does it appear to have any systemic effects on cardiovascular disease safety parameters (including increased risk of polycythemia) beyond those commonly observed with available T preparations. Well-controlled, long-term studies of transdermal DHT preparations have failed to identify safety signals unique to markedly elevated circulating DHT concentrations or signals materially different from T., Circulating levels of DHT in response to testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) do not correlate with those found in androgen sensitive tissue due to homeostatic control of intracellular DHT.},

  abstract = {Background A relatively high mortality of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is worrying, the application of heparin in COVID-19 has been recommended by some expert consensus due to the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation and venous thromboembolism. However, its efficacy remains to be validated. Methods Coagulation results, medications and outcomes of consecutive patients being classified as severe COVID-19 in Tongji hospital were retrospectively analysed. The 28-day mortality between heparin users and nonusers were compared, also in different risk of coagulopaphy which was stratified by the sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) score or D-dimer result. Results There were 449 patients with severe COVID-19 enrolled into the study, 99 of them received heparin (mainly with low molecular weight heparin, LMWH) for 7 days or longer. The D-dimer, prothrombin time and age were positively, and platelet count was negatively, correlated with 28-day mortality in multivariate analysis. No difference on 28-day mortality was found between heparin users and nonusers (30.3\% vs 29.7\%, P=0.910). But the 28-day mortality of heparin users were lower than nonusers In patients with SIC score {$\geq$}4 (40.0\% vs 64.2\%, P=0.029), or D-dimer {$>$} 6 fold of upper limit of normal (32.8\% vs 52.4\%, P=0.017). Conclusions Anticoagulant therapy mainly with LMWH appears to be associated with better prognosis in severe COVID-19 patients meeting SIC criteria or with markedly elevated D-dimer.},

Design Multicentre, open label, randomised controlled trial. Setting 16 government designated covid-19 treatment centres in China, 11 to 29 February 2020. Participants 150 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed covid-19 were included in the intention to treat analysis (75 patients assigned to hydroxychloroquine plus standard of care, 75 to standard of care alone). Interventions Hydroxychloroquine administrated at a loading dose of 1200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintenance dose of 800 mg daily (total treatment duration: two or three weeks for patients with mild to moderate or severe disease, respectively). Main outcome measure Negative conversion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by 28 days, analysed according to the intention to treat principle. Adverse events were analysed in the safety population in which hydroxychloroquine recipients were participants who received at least one dose of hydroxychloroquine and hydroxychloroquine non-recipients were those managed with standard of care alone. Results Of 150 patients, 148 had mild to moderate disease and two had severe disease. The mean duration from symptom onset to randomisation was 16.6 (SD 10.5; range 3-41) days. A total of 109 (73\%) patients (56 standard of care; 53 standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine) had negative conversion well before 28 days, and the remaining 41 (27\%) patients (19 standard of care; 22 standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine) were censored as they did not reach negative conversion of virus. The probability of negative conversion by 28 days in the standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine group was 85.4\% (95\% confidence interval 73.8\% to 93.8\%), similar to that in the standard of care group (81.3\%, 71.2\% to 89.6\%). The difference between groups was 4.1\% (95\% confidence interval \textendash 10.3\% to 18.5\%). In the safety population, adverse events were recorded in 7/80 (9\%) hydroxychloroquine non-recipients and in 21/70 (30\%) hydroxychloroquine recipients. The most common adverse event in the hydroxychloroquine recipients was diarrhoea, reported in 7/70 (10\%) patients. Two hydroxychloroquine recipients reported serious adverse events. Conclusions Administration of hydroxychloroquine did not result in a significantly higher probability of negative conversion than standard of care alone in patients admitted to hospital with mainly persistent mild to moderate covid-19. Adverse events were higher in hydroxychloroquine recipients than in non-recipients. Trial registration ChiCTR2000029868.},

Individual subjects were randomly assigned to one of three protein intakes: low protein (LP) = 0.86 g protein.kg-1.day-1, moderate protein (MP) = 1.40 g protein.kg-1.day-1, or high protein (HP) = 2.40 g protein.kg-1.day-1 for 13 days for each dietary treatment. NBAL was measured and whole body protein synthesis (WBPS) and leucine oxidation were determined from L-[1\textendash 13C]leucine turnover. NBAL data were used to determine that the protein intake for zero NBAL for S was 0.69 g.kg-1.day-1 and for SA was 1.41 g.kg-1.day-1. A suggested recommended intake for S was 0.89 g.kg-1.day-1 and for SA was 1.76 g.kg-1.day-1. For SA, the LP diet did not provide adequate protein and resulted in an accommodated state (decreased WBPS vs. MP and HP), and the MP diet resulted in a state of adaptation [increase in WBPS (vs. LP) and no change in leucine oxidation (vs. LP)]. The HP diet did not result in increased WBPS compared with the MP diet, but leucine oxidation did increase significantly, indicating a nutrient overload. For S the LP diet provided adequate protein, and increasing protein intake did not increase WBPS. On the HP diet leucine oxidation increased for S. These results indicated that the MP and HP diets were nutrient overloads for S. There were no effects of varying protein intake on indexes of lean body mass (creatinine excretion, body density) for either group. In summary, protein requirements for athletes performing strength training are greater than for sedentary individuals and are above current Canadian and US recommended daily protein intake requirements for young healthy males.},

However, subsets of both female and male athletes are at increased risk of impaired bone health and bone stress injuries. The Female Athlete Triad (Triad) is defined as the interrelationship of low energy availability (with or without disordered eating), menstrual dysfunction, and low bone mineral density. The Triad may result in health consequences, including bone stress injuries. Our review presents evidence that an analogous process may occur in male athletes. Our review of the available literature indicates that a subset of male athletes may experience adverse health issues that parallel those associated with the Triad, including low energy availability (with or without disordered eating), hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and low bone mineral density. Consequently, male athletes may be predisposed to developing bone stress injuries, and these injuries can be the first presenting feature of associated Triad conditions. We discuss the evidence for impaired nutrition, hormonal dysfunction, and low bone mineral density in a subset of male athletes, and how these health issues may parallel those of the Triad. With further research into the mechanisms and outcomes of these health concerns in active and athletic men, evidence-based guidelines can be developed that result in best practice.},

The antibody works against the GAD enzyme, which is essential in the formation of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter found in the brain. Patients found with this antibody present with motor and cognitive problems due to low levels or lack of GABA, because in the absence or low levels of GABA patients exhibit motor and cognitive symptoms. The anti-GAD antibody is found in some neurological syndromes, including stiff-person syndrome, paraneoplastic stiff-person syndrome, Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), limbic encephalopathy, cerebellar ataxia, eye movement disorders, and epilepsy. Previously, excluding MFS, these conditions were called `hyperexcitability disorders'. However, collectively, these syndromes should be known as ``anti-GAD positive neurological syndromes.'' An important limitation of this study is that the literature is lacking on the subject, and why patients with the above mentioned neurological problems present with different symptoms has not been studied in detail.

As reaffirmed by the recent MERS outbreak in South Korea, highly pathogenic coronaviruses are capable of causing epidemics affecting hundreds of individuals as a result of sustained person-to-person transmission in nosocomial settings that can be linked to a single traveler who became an index patient (2). Currently, the best public health strategy to circumvent sustained coronavirus transmission in an outbreak situation is to quarantine individuals who have a history of contact with confirmed cases of MERS.

  abstract = {Introduction In Haglund syndrome, standard radiologic measurements lack specificity and reliability in assessing etiologic morphologic calcaneal abnormalities. We report a simple X/Y ratio to measure posterior calcaneal length, where X is calcaneal length on lateral weight-bearing view and Y is greater tuberosity length. Objective To compare this new parameter against the radiologic gold standard in a group of Haglund patients and a healthy control group. Hypothesis Measuring this ratio significantly distinguishes between Haglund patients and healthy subjects. Material and methods A retrospective study included 50 Haglund syndrome patients and 30 healthy controls. Standard measurements (Fowler-Philipangle, Chauveaux-Liet angle, Ruch pitch, Heneghan-Pavlov test) and X/Y ratio were calculated twice by 2 independent observers. Intra- and inter-observer correlations were calculated, as were the specificity and sensitivity of the various parameters, with a ROC curve to establish the X/Y threshold. Results All measurements were reproducible on intra- and inter-observer testing. There were no significant inter-group differences in standard measurement specificity or sensitivity. The Haglund group showed significantly lower X/Y ratio (2.07) than controls (2.70; p{$<$}0.0001), with a cut-off at 2.5. Threshold sensitivity in confirming Haglund syndrome was 100\% (p{$<$}0.0001) and specificity 95\% (p{$<$}0.0001). Discussion This new parameter measures the length of the calcaneus and its greater tuberosity. It is more reliable and reproducible in terms of sensitivity and specificity than standard measurements in Haglund syndrome. The 2.5 ratio threshold can guide surgical decision-making.

  abstract = {Objectives: This study sought to assess the long-term predictive value and net reclassification for risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) of biomarkers reflecting oxidation-specific epitopes (OSEs). Background: OSEs are immunogenic, proinflammatory, and proatherogenic. The long-term predictive value and net reclassification of OSEs for risk of CVD events are not known. Methods: Oxidized phospholipids on apolipoprotein B-100 (OxPL/apoB) and immunoglobulin (Ig)-G (IgG) and IgM autoantibodies to malondialdehyde-modified, low-density lipoprotein (MDA-LDL) and copper-oxidized LDL (Cu-OxLDL) were measured in 765 subjects in 1995 and 656 subjects in 2000 in the Bruneck study, representing 45- to 84-year-old men and women from the general community. Results: Over 15 years of follow-up, 138 subjects reached the primary endpoint of incident CVD (ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, new-onset unstable angina, acute coronary interventions, and vascular death). In a multivariable Cox model, the highest tertile of OxPL/apoB was associated with higher risk of CVD (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.4; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5 to 3.7) and stroke (HR: 3.6; 95\% CI: 1.8 to 7.4) compared with the lowest tertile. IgG Cu-OxLDLs were associated with higher risk of CVD, whereas IgM MDA-LDLs were associated with lower risk. Using OxPL/apoB, IgG Cu-OxLDL, and IgM MDA-LDL variables, the area under the curve (AUC) for CVD risk prediction increased from 0.664 (95\% CI: 0.629 to 0.697) to 0.705 (95\% CI: 0.672 to 0.737) (p = 0.048). The net reclassification index (NRI) was 0.163 (p = 0.0044) and 0.332 (p \textbackslash textless 0.0001) in all subjects (n = 765) and in subjects with intermediate risk (n = 305), respectively. Of 627 subjects who remained free of CVD, 108 were correctly reclassified to a lower risk category, and 83 were reclassified to a higher category (categories: 15-year risk \textbackslash textless15\%, 15\% to 30\%, \textbackslash textgreater30\%). Conclusions: OSE biomarkers predict 15-year CVD and stroke outcomes and provide potential clinical utility by reclassifying a significant proportion of individuals into higher or lower risk categories after traditional risk assessment. \textcopyright{} 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

  abstract = {GnRH plays an essential role in neuroendocrine control of reproductive function. In mammals, the pattern of gonadotropin secretion includes both pulse and surge phases, which are regulated independently. The pulsatile release of GnRH and LH plays an important role in the development of sexual function and in the normal regulation of the menstrual cycle. The importance of GnRH pulsatility was established in a series of classic studies. Fertility is impaired when GnRH pulsatility is inhibited by chronic malnutrition, excessive caloric expenditure, or aging. A number of reproductive disorders in women with including hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, hypothlamic amenorrhea, hyperprolactinemia and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are also associated with disruption of the normal pulsatile GnRH secretion. Despite these findings, the molecular mechanisms of this pulsatile GnRH regulation are not well understood. Here, we review recent studies about GnRH pulsatility, signaling and transcriptional response, and its implications for disease.},

A vitamin C deficiency prevalence of 10 to 14\% in adults was reported in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in 1994. Objective We report the case of a 57-year-old male who presented with a combined vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) and a Zinc deficiency. Interventions He came to the emergency department complaining of a painful swollen ecchymotic leg and dyspnea. Prescriptions for narcotics did not relieve his symptoms. When a detailed dietary history was obtained, we added scurvy to the differential diagnosis. An extensive evaluation excluded trauma, coagulopathies, neoplasia, and vasculitides. Main Result The combination of a classic skin biopsy and a low vitamin C level confirmed the diagnosis. Conclusion This presentation illustrates the necessity of including scurvy in the differential diagnosis of ecchymoses and demonstrates specific populations at risk: single adults and the elderly with deficient diets.},

  abstract = {Concerns have been raised regarding the availability of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) during an influenza pandemic. One possible strategy to mitigate a respirator shortage is to reuse FFRs following a biological decontamination process to render infectious material on the FFR inactive. However, little data exist on the effects of decontamination methods on respirator integrity and performance. This study evaluated five decontamination methods [ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), ethylene oxide, vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), microwave oven irradiation, and bleach] using nine models of NIOSH-certified respirators (three models each of N95 FFRs, surgical N95 respirators, and P100 FFRs) to determine which methods should be considered for future research studies. Following treatment by each decontamination method, the FFRs were evaluated for changes in physical appearance, odor, and laboratory performance (filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance). Additional experiments (dry heat laboratory oven exposures, off-gassing, and FFR hydrophobicity) were subsequently conducted to better understand material properties and possible health risks to the respirator user following decontamination. However, this study did not assess the efficiency of the decontamination methods to inactivate viable microorganisms. Microwave oven irradiation melted samples from two FFR models. The remainder of the FFR samples that had been decontaminated had expected levels of filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance. The scent of bleach remained noticeable following overnight drying and low levels of chlorine gas were found to off-gas from bleach-decontaminated FFRs when rehydrated with deionized water. UVGI, ethylene oxide (EtO), and VHP were found to be the most promising decontamination methods; however, concerns remain about the throughput capabilities for EtO and VHP. Further research is needed before any specific decontamination methods can be recommended.},

Methods: A PubMed/Medline search on the topics of endurance, athletes, nutrition, and performance was undertaken and a review performed summarizing the current evidence concerning macronutrients, hydration, and supplements as it pertains to endurance athletes. Results: Carbohydrate and hydration recommendations have not drastically changed in years, while protein and fat intake have been traditionally underemphasized in endurance athletes. Several supplements are commercially available to athletes, of which, few may be of benefit for endurance activities, including nitrates, antioxidants, caffeine, and probiotics, and are reviewed here. The topic of ``train low,'' training in a low carbohydrate state is also discussed, and the post-exercise nutritional ``recovery window'' remains an important point to emphasize to endurance competitors. Conclusions: This review summarizes the key recommendations for macronutrients, hydration, and supplements for endurance athletes, and helps clinicians treating endurance athletes clear up misconceptions in sports nutrition research when counseling the endurance athlete.},

A comparison cohort of 303640 persons without appendectomy was selected randomly, frequency matched by age, sex, comorbidity and entry year was also selected. We monitored subsequent colorectal cancer development in both cohorts. Results The overall colorectal cancer incidence was 14\% higher in the appendectomy patients than in the comparison cohort (p {$<$}0.05): the highest incidence was observed for rectal cancer, and the lowest incidence was observed for cancer of the cecum-ascending colon for both cohorts. Men were at higher risk than women. Subjects {$\geq$} 60 years had an HR of 12.8 compared to those {$<$}60 years. The incidence of colorectal cancer was much higher in 1.5-3.5 years post appendectomy follow-up than for the comparisons (HR of 2.13). Patients who received an incidental appendectomy had an HR of 2.90 when compared to the comparisons. Conclusions Results of our study suggest that appendectomy in patients with appendicitis is likely associated with the development of colorectal cancer in the post-surgery period.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Background The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus threatens global public health. Currently, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) versus this virus are expected to correlate with recovery and protection of this disease. However, the characteristics of these antibodies have not been well studied in association with the clinical manifestations in patients. Methods Plasma collected from 175 COVID-19 recovered patients with mild symptoms were screened using a safe and sensitive pseudotyped-lentiviral-vector-based neutralization assay. Spike-binding antibody in plasma were determined by ELISA using RBD, S1, and S2 proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The levels and the time course of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs and the spike-binding antibodies were monitored at the same time. Findings SARS-CoV-2 NAbs were unable to cross-reactive with SARS-CoV virus. SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs were detected in patients from day 10-15 after the onset of the disease and remained thereafter. The titers of NAb among these patients correlated with the spike-binding antibodies targeting S1, RBD, and S2 regions. The titers of NAbs were variable in different patients. Elderly and middle-age patients had significantly higher plasma NAb titers (P\&lt;0.0001) and spike-binding antibodies (P=0.0003) than young patients. Notably, among these patients, there were ten patients whose NAb titers were under the detectable level of our assay (ID50: \&lt; 40); while in contrast, two patients, showed very high titers of NAb, with ID50 :15989 and 21567 respectively. The NAb titers were positive correlated with plasma CRP levels but negative correlated with the lymphocyte counts of patients at the time of admission, indicating an association between humoral response and cellular immune response. Interpretation The variations of SARS-CoV-2 specific NAbs in recovered COVID-19 patients may raise the concern about the role of NAbs on disease progression. The correlation of NAb titers with age, lymphocyte counts, and blood CRP levels suggested that the interplay between virus and host immune response in coronavirus infections should be further explored for the development of effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 virus. Furthermore, titration of NAb is helpful prior to the use of convalescent plasma for prevention or treatment.

In the light of this question, this review aimed to highlight all researches and insights into the association between the use of CC and risk of genotoxicity, cytotoxicity, embryotoxicity, teratogenicity and risk of different cancer types. We conducted a MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar search. After a careful screening process of all authors, 32 of these articles were considered as appropriate, and reviewed. Our evaluations showed that CC has genotoxic, cytotoxic, embryotoxic and teratogenic properties. There is no association between the use of CC and risk of ovarian, breast, uterine, cervix, endometrium, lung, colorectal cancer, and lymphoma. However, risk increased especially after 6 cycles of use and especially in nulligravid women. The use of CC should be restricted to 6 cycles. Moreover, malignant melanoma and thyroid cancer risk was found to be higher among CC treated women in almost all studies. Further works should be conducted especially in animal models to assess its risk features.},

Although it is known that EE and CIT vary seasonally, their relationship with BAT has not been investigated. In the present study, we examined the impact of BAT on seasonal variations of EE/CIT and thermal responses to cold exposure in a randomized crossover design. Forty-five healthy male volunteers participated, and their BAT was assessed by positron emission tomography and computed tomography. CIT, the difference of EE at 27\textdegree C and after 2-h cold exposure at 19\textdegree C, significantly increased in winter compared with summer, being greater in subjects with metabolically active BAT (High BAT, 185.6 kcal/day vs. 18.3 kcal/day, P {$<$} 0.001) than those without (Low BAT, 90.6 kcal/day vs. -46.5 kcal/day, P {$<$} 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis revealed a significant interaction effect between season and BAT on CIT (P {$<$} 0.001). The cold-induced drop of tympanic temperature (Tty) and skin temperature (Tskin) in the forehead region and in the supraclavicular region close to BAT deposits were smaller in the High BAT Group than in the Low BAT Group in winter but not in summer. In contrast, the drop of Tskin in the subclavicular and peripheral regions distant from BAT was similar in the two groups in both seasons. In conclusion, CIT increased from summer to winter in a BAT-dependent manner, paralleling cold-induced changes in Tty/Tskin, indicating a role of BAT in seasonal changes in the thermogenic and thermal responses to cold exposure in humans.},

  abstract = {Background Long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3-PUFA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) provide multiple health benefits for heart, brain and eyes. However, consumption of fatty fish, the main source of LC n-3-PUFAs is low in Western countries. Intakes of LC n-3-PUFA can be increased by taking dietary supplements, such as fish oil, algal oil, or krill oil. Recently, conflicting information was published on the relative bioavailability of these omega-3 supplements. A few studies suggested that the phospholipid form (krill) is better absorbed than the fish oil ethyl ester (EE) or triglyceride (TG) forms. Yet studies did not match the doses administered nor the concentrations of DHA and EPA per supplement across such comparisons, leading to questionable conclusions. This study was designed to compare the oral bioavailability of the same dose of both EPA and DHA in fish oil-EE vs. fish oil-TG vs. krill oil in plasma at the end of a four-week supplementation. Methods Sixty-six healthy adults (n\,=\,22/arm) were enrolled in a double blind, randomized, three-treatment, multi-dose, parallel study. Subjects were supplemented with a 1.3~g/d dose of EPA\,+\,DHA (approximately 816~mg/d EPA\,+\,522~mg/d DHA, regardless of formulation) for 28 consecutive days, as either fish oil-EE, fish oil-TG or krill oil capsules (6 caps/day). Plasma and red blood cell (RBC) samples were collected at baseline (pre-dose on Day 1) and at 4, 8, 12, 48, 72, 336, and 672~h. Total plasma EPA\,+\,DHA levels at Week 4 (Hour 672) were measured as the primary endpoint. Results No significant differences in total plasma EPA\,+\,DHA at 672~h were observed between fish oil-EE (mean\,=\,90.9\,{$\pm$}\,41 ug/mL), fish oil-TG (mean\,=\,108\,{$\pm$}\,40 ug/mL), and krill oil (mean\,=\,118.5\,{$\pm$}\,48 ug/mL), p\,=\,0.052 and bioavailability differed by {$<$}24~\% between the groups. Additionally, DHA\,+\,EPA levels were not significantly different in RBCs among the 3 formulations, p\,=\,0.19, providing comparable omega-3 indexes. Conclusions Similar plasma and RBC levels of EPA\,+\,DHA were achieved across fish oil and krill oil products when matched for dose, EPA, and DHA concentrations in this four week study, indicating comparable oral bioavailability irrespective of formulation.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Background A recently developing pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 was originated in Wuhan, China, and has quickly spread across the world. We reported the clinical characteristics of 82 death cases with COVID-19 in a single center. Methods Clinical data on 82 death cases laboratory-confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection were obtained from a Wuhan local hospital{${'}$}s electronic medical records according to previously designed standardized data collection forms. Findings All patients were local residents of Wuhan, and the great proportion of them were diagnosed as severe illness when admitted. Most of the death cases were male (65.9\%). More than half of dead patients were older than 60 years (80.5\%) and the median age was 72.5 years. The bulk of death cases had comorbidity (76.8\%), including hypertension (56.1\%), heart disease (20.7\%), diabetes (18.3\%), cerebrovascular disease (12.2\%), and cancer (7.3\%). Respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death (69.5\%), following by sepsis syndrome/MOF (28.0\%), cardiac failure (14.6\%), hemorrhage (6.1\%), and renal failure (3.7\%). Furthermore, respiratory, cardiac, hemorrhage, hepatic, and renal damage were found in 100\%, 89\%, 80.5\%, 78.0\%, and 31.7\% of patients, respectively. On the admission, lymphopenia (89.2\%), neutrophilia (74.3\%), and thrombocytopenia (24.3\%) were usually observed. Most patients had a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of \&gt;5 (94.5\%), high systemic immune-inflammation index of \&gt;500 (89.2\%), increased C-reactive protein level (100\%), lactate dehydrogenase (93.2\%), and D-dimer (97.1\%). A high level of IL-6 (\&gt;10 pg/ml) was observed in all detected patients. Median time from initial symptom to death was 15 days (IQR 11-20), and a significant association between aspartate aminotransferase (p=0.002), alanine aminotransferase (p=0.037) and time from initial symptom to death were interestingly observed. Conclusion Older males with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe disease, even die from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Respiratory failure is the main cause of COVID-19, but either virus itself or cytokine release storm mediated damage to other organ including cardiac, renal, hepatic, and hemorrhage should be taken seriously as well.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Here, we have conducted an online search for all treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA-virus infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19. We suggest that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated before the administration of general treatments and the current children's RNA-virus vaccines including influenza vaccine should be immunized for uninfected people and health care workers. In addition, convalescent plasma should be given to COVID-19 patients if it is available. In conclusion, we suggest that all the potential interventions be implemented to control the emerging COVID-19 if the infection is uncontrollable.},

Information was obtained from a search of medical and scientific literature that produced 3001 entries, of which 591 publications containing particularly relevant data were identified, and from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Events Reporting System (AERS) and Spontaneous Reporting System through June 30, 2004. For the AERS data and to control for overreporting in the first postmarketing year and the effect on reporting due to the withdrawal of cerivastatin in 2001, we used the rate of a given adverse event among all adverse events as a measure of risk. We found that adverse effects of rosuvastatin in skeletal muscle, liver, and kidney function did not substantially differ in frequency from those reported for those of other statins in the market in 2004, except for the uncommon development of a mild form of presumably ``tubular'' proteinuria at doses of 40 mg/day or greater. In contrast, cerivastatin had significantly higher rates of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis than rosuvastatin's, but there was no additional effect on renal failure beyond that mediated through rhabdomyolysis. From our literature review, we found that rosuvastatin reduces abnormal lipids on a milligram-per-milligram comparison more than atorvastatin. Conclusion We conclude that rosuvastatin at approved doses incurs no greater risk for adverse events than other marketed statins, except for a mild form of tubular proteinuria when doses at or above the maximum recommended levels ({$\geq$} 40 mg/day) were administered. Its risk-benefit ratio is acceptable when compared with other statins on the market in 2006.},

  abstract = {Many public officials are calling for increased testing for the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and some governments have taken extraordinary measures to increase the availability of testing. However, little has been published about the sensitivity and specificity of the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nasopharyngeal swabs that are commonly used for testing. This narrative review evaluates the literature regarding the accuracy of these tests, and makes recommendations based on this literature. In brief, a negative RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab test is insufficient to rule out COVID-19. Thus, over-reliance on the results of the test may be dangerous, and the push for widespread testing may be overstated.},

The conference was held on 1 December 2016. It is a joint initiative of the Dermatology Section of the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), the EU-founded network of excellence, the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA{$^2$}LEN), the European Dermatology Forum (EDF) and the World Allergy Organization (WAO) with the participation of 48 delegates of 42 national and international societies. This guideline was acknowledged and accepted by the European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS). Urticaria is a frequent, mast cell-driven disease, presenting with wheals, angioedema, or both. The lifetime prevalence for acute urticaria is approximately 20\%. Chronic spontaneous urticaria and other chronic forms of urticaria are disabling, impair quality of life and affect performance at work and school. This guideline covers the definition and classification of urticaria, taking into account the recent progress in identifying its causes, eliciting factors and pathomechanisms. In addition, it outlines evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the different subtypes of urticaria.},
