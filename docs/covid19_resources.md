## Trusted Sources and Vetted Information
A trusted source is an individual or group of individuals who consistently demonstrate the following virtues: benevolence, reason, honesty, and integrity. These are people who seek to create value through their allegiance to truth above all else. These people qualify their degree of certainty, actively police themselves for mistakes, and pride themselves on the value, quality, and clarity of their work.

Vetted information is information that I have personally reviewed and integrated with the rest of my knowledge on the topic. This means not that it is definitive or gauranteed to be correct, just that it is consistent with my personal knowledge at the time of review.
