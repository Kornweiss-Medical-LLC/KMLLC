A True Story of Appendicitis
</p>

<!-- insert body of document -->
There was once a young healthy man. He went to work, ate healthy food, exercised daily, and loved his wife. One night, the man was preparing for bed when he noticed some mild discomfort around his belly button. He didn't think much of it. He pushed on it a bit and it felt better, so he went to bed. In the middle of the night, the man woke up feeling hot and restless. This didn't happen to the man very often; but after shedding his blanket, he easily went back to sleep. In the morning, the man bathed, dressed, and went to work. At work, he ate a delicious breakfast of sausage, eggs, and potatoes, and drank a coffee. About an hour after breakfast, the man noticed slight pain deep in his abdomen. It didn't hurt too badly; he thought he needed merely to use the bathroom; but after doing so, the pain did not improve.

The man wasn't sure what was wrong, but luckily, he worked in a hospital. So, he consulted a doctor. The doctor pressed on the man's abdomen. When the doctor pressed on a spot between the man's groin and his belly button on the right side, the man felt a pain.

Then, the doctor brought an ultrasound machine into the room (the same type of machine that's used to perform sonograms of pregnancies).  The doctor placed the ultrasound probe on the man's abdomen and noticed a tubular structure. On the black and white screen, the tube looked like a white circle with a black circle around it. Inside the white circle was another white semicircle with a black shadow behind it.

The doctor explained that the outer black circle was fluid surrounding a special part of the bowel called the appendix. "The appendix," the doctor went on, "is a small tube of bowel that sticks out from the cecum, which is the junction between the colon (large bowel) and the small bowel.

On the screen of the ultrasound machine, the doctor pointed to a white circle, the appendix, and the semicircle inside of it, a stone. The doctor explained that stones can form in the appendix when stool gets stuck in the appendix and calcify over time. The doctor said, this is appendicitis. It's a condition that can occur when the appendix is clogged and becomes swollen and infected.

But then, the doctor said he was surprised that the man didn't seem to be in much pain. He also didn't have a fever, nausea, or vomiting, symptoms typical of appendicitis. The doctor was also surprised that the man didn't seem to feel that sick. In fact, the man was able to continue working. Perplexed, the doctor consulted a second doctor.

The second doctor was a much more experienced doctor. The second doctor took one look at the man and said, "this man does __not__ have appendicitis." The second doctor said he knew this because the man was still able to walk around, and did not seem to like standing still. The second doctor explained, when the appendix is inflamed, it causes inflammation of the lining of the abdominal cavity (called the peritoneum - seen outlined in red below in this drawing of a cross-section of an abdominal cavity from Gray's Anatomy).

When the peritoneum is inflamed, it's very painful to move. The second doctor believed that the first doctor was crazy. So, the first doctor showed the ultrasound to the second doctor. The second doctor still did not agree. Both doctors agreed that more information was needed.

So, the first doctor ordered a CT scan. A CT scan is a cross-sectional image formed by using an x-ray gun which rotates around the patient and shoots x-rays through the patient at different angles. The computer takes the data from each angle and computes a series of images which appear flat on a screen, but when viewed by a doctor who is specially trained to interpret CT scans (and other radiographs), called a "radiologist," the series of images provides a 3-dimensional visualization of the inside of the patient's body.

On the CT scan, the first doctor was able to see a very swollen, enlarged appendix with a big stone in the middle. He could also see signs of inflammation around the appendix. The CT scan revealed that the man __did__ have appendicitis. 

The first doctor told the man that he had appendicitis, and that, because the appendix was very inflamed, and blocked by a stone, that the best treatment option was surgery. The first doctor explained that sometimes appendicitis can be effectively treated with antibiotics alone, but in this case, antibiotics would likely fail. And, in the case of failure, the appendix could break open, and leak stool and bacteria into the man's abdominal cavity. This could cause loops of bowel to stick to one another, and could cause the infection to spread, and cause other pockets of infection deep within the man's body that could be hard to remove.

One hour later, the man met yet another doctor. This doctor is called an anesthesiologist. She explained to the man that he would be given general anesthesia for his surgery. This meant that he would be rendered unconscious by a mixture of medications - some injected through the man's intravenous line, and others inhaled through a breathing mask. After the man was unconscious, the doctor would inject another medicine to paralyze the man's muscles so that he cannot breathe or move. This is to decrease the risk that the man might move while the surgeon is operating. Once the medications take effect, the anesthesia doctor would use a special device called a laryngoscope to open the man's mouth and insert a breathing tube into his trachea; the tube would then be hooked to a machine called a ventilator. The ventilator would be set to breathe for the man while he was paralyzed during the surgery. The man could also be kept unconscious with gases that can be pumped through the ventilation circuit.

Next, another doctor called a surgeon came in. He explained how he would do the surgery. He indicated that he would make 3 small incisions on the man's abdomen, each about one inch long - one by the belly button (umbilicus), one over the bladder, and one by the left groin. Through each incision, the surgeon said he would insert a different device. The incision by the umbilicus would be used for a small camera. Using the camera, the surgeon would be able to see what's happening on the inside of the man's abdomen. Next, the surgeon would inflate the man's abdomen like a balloon by pumping carbon dioxide in through one of the ports. Next, the surgeon would insert graspers to move the bowels around in order to find the appendix. And, finally, the surgeon said he would use a special tool to cut out the appendix and seal the opening (where the appendix used to be) with staples. The appendix would be removed through one of the ports, the gas evacuated from the abdomen, and the incisions closed with glue.

The procedure went as planned, and the man woke up an hour later in the anesthesia care unit for recovery. Sixty minute later, the man was wheeled to his car and driven home.

For the next seven days, the man nursed himself back to health. He checked his incisions every day for signs of infection, like worsening pain, redness, or tenderness. He took pictures of them daily so that he could compare one day to the next. The man took a stool softener called polyethylene glycol to keep his bowels soft. On the third day after surgery, the man was able to move his bowels. The man walked every day for at least 30 minutes, but usually more than an hour. The man slept, a lot. And, the man ate healthy food to help himself heal; he ate eggs, rice, meat, bits of bread and vegetables, and fish.  He drank plenty of water, some tea, and a little bit of coffee. The man did not take any medicine. The man's stomach felt swollen and heavy every day, and he often had strange sharp pains deep within his abdomen. This improved a little bit each day.  The pain was never so bad that it was intolerable, but it was scary. The man worried that something was still wrong every time he felt a pain.

On day six, the man received a message from the hospital. Another doctor, a doctor called a pathologist examined the man's appendix which had been removed in the operating room. This doctor is specially trained to examine pieces of people's bodies and also to perform whole autopsies (examination of dead people) to find out what is (or was) wrong. The pathologist determined that the man definitely had appendicitis by looking at the appendix with his naked eye, and by examining thin slices of the appendix under a microscope.

By the seventh day, the man was able to sit up and down with ease. He had very little pain, but still did not feel back to normal. By day eight, the man was back to work.

If you haven't already guessed, the man in this story, and the first doctor, are both me. Having surgery was, and still is, one of my biggest fears. As an emergency physician, I do not see any surgeries that go well. I see only complications. The patients who do well do not find themselves back in the ER. I know of nearly every complication that can happen in a surgery like this, so the fact that I am now 3 weeks post-op and have no complications at this point is a huge relief, and due in no small part to the brilliant work of generations of doctors and scientists, and of course my surgical team.

There were six doctors involved in my care, two CT technologists, at least six nurses, and several other assistants. Tiny mistakes in diagnosis or treatment, or just bad luck, such as an allergy to a medication, can cause a major problem. Even if every single person and piece of equipment perform perfectly, there is no guarantee that something still won't go wrong. Cutting out organs and keeping someone alive while they're paralyzed are incredible feats of engineering, training, focus, and active thought. I do not take these achievements for granted.

I learned a lot from this ordeal.

First, I learned what it felt like to be misdiagnosed and labeled a crazy person by my own colleague. In my case, it didn't matter much, because I was both patient and physician, and I was fairly certain of my own diagnosis. But, ultimately this was upsetting. I could easily see how any patient when treated this way would harbor extreme anger and hold a very strong grudge. It's not the mistake that would be grudge worthy, but the feeling of being told you're out of your mind, and not being listened to that could drive one to revenge. I believe I learned long ago that what the great Dr. Osler said is true, "Listen to your patient, he is telling you the diagnosis." In this case, I quite literally told my colleague my diagnosis, and he was still in disbelief.

Second, I learned that it's good to be nice. Imagine that you weren't very nice to someone, and now they're performing surgery on you. This is an especially good reminder for people who work in medicine - what if I had just treated my surgical colleague poorly the day before, and now I need his help. Even though I am sure he would have done his best work anyway, it's impossible to not feel some bias as a human being. Everybody can learn from this in any human relationship - usually there is more common ground than not between two people, and even if there is a disagreement, politeness always seems to work best both in the moment, and in the future. I've learned this one the hard way a couple times already, no need to learn it again.

Third, I learned what the psychological fear of patient-hood feels like. I know that an appendectomy is one of the simplest operations, and that mine in particular was extremely straightforward. But, I cannot help but think that every post-op twinge and pain is from an abscess, a hernia, or some other disaster that will ultimately lead to complication after complication - as I have so often seen. Because of my profession, I can quite rapidly invoke mental images of cascades of surgical and medical disasters resulting in my disability or demise. For those who work outside the medical profession, the terror might be even worse, because the unknown can be the scariest thing of all. For me, I can at least make reasonable interpretations of my pain, for those without medical training, the imagination could run wild. Doctors should do better to recognize that most patients just want to understand what's going on. People don't expect miracles. Diagnosis and prognosis go quite a long way even when treatment options are limited.

Last, I reinforced what I already knew about health. One of the best reasons to optimize my health on a daily basis is to cope with unexpected challenges like this. I thought because of my healthy diet, regular bowels (sorry) that I would never have appendicitis. But, I got it anyway. The good news is that I try to keep myself in an optimal state of health for many reasons, one of which is to be able to cope with unforeseen health threats. Is it easier to perform surgery on someone who is thin, or not thin? Is it easier to heal when you are nutritionally replete, or deficient in important nutrients? Will you be strong and fit after two weeks of sedentary recovery if you haven't been training beforehand? What if you have an operative infection, a blood clot, or some other compound tragedy; is your body ready? I was ready, but I could have been even more ready than I was. When I am fully recovered, I'll be back on the path, ready for the next challenge.
