**Achieving Values during a Pandemic**
*Last Updated: 2020-04-08*

This post is a collection of great things that have resulted from the 2019 novel coronavirus and the subsequent pandemic. My plan is to add to this list on a daily basis. I'll add to the top of the page and I'll date my additions.

### Recognizing the Value of Direct Care (4/8/20)

Direct primary care (DPC) practices have grown rapidly in the past 5-10 years. This practice model allows patients to contract directly with doctors, usually on a subscription basis, to obtain access to private, concierge level care that in past decades would have only been available to the uber wealthy. In many cases, this service is now attainable for $50-$150 monthly and affords members personalized care, same-day appointments, telemedicine visits, sometimes home visits, and wholesale medications, labs, and radiology. Doctors are able to spend tons of time with their patients, because they aren't required to fill out forms or to see 3-5 patients in an hour to make ends meet. Direct care is perfectly positioned to help patients during crises. [This article](https://www.medicaleconomics.com/med-ec-blog/direct-care-practices-perfectly-positioned-help-patients-during-coronavirus-outbreak) elaborates on the details.

### "*More Progress, Faster, Is Our Best Defense Against This Pandemic and Future Ones*" (4/7/20)

[This article](https://leapsmag.com/more-progress-faster-is-our-best-defense-against-this-pandemic-and-future-ones/) by Jason Crawford [@rootsofprogress](https://twitter.com/rootsofprogress) published on <http://leapsmag.com> is the rare ray of light that recognizes how easily we can deal with this pandemic as a result of our progress in science, technology, and industry. He writes:

> "If you're seeking to avoid COVID-19, the hand sanitizer gel you carry in a pocket or purse did not exist until the 1960s. If you start to show symptoms, the pulse oximeter that tests your blood oxygenation was not developed until the 1970s. If your case worsens, the mechanical ventilator that keeps you alive was invented in the 1950s—in fact, no form of artificial respiration was widely available until the "iron lung" used to treat polio patients in the 1930s. Even the modern emergency medical system did not exist until recently: if during the 1918 flu pandemic you became seriously ill, there was no 911 hotline to call, and any ambulance that showed up would likely have been a modified van or hearse, with no equipment or trained staff."

Recognizing the advances that seem commonplace now, but that were unthinkable to the past generation, can keep us positive and motivated. Note the difference in mindset between feeling dismay, anger, and frustration at having to wipe down everything in your home with Clorox wipes or in having to sanitize your hands repeatedly; versus the attitude of realizing how much easier things are because of Clorox wipes and hand sanitizers. 

### What's good about a quarantine? (4/5/20)

### An Awesome Article about Healthcare Deregulation (4/5/20)

[The Objective Standard](https://www.theobjectivestandard.com/) published an awesome article titled ["Silver Linings in State Responses to COVID-19"](https://www.theobjectivestandard.com/2020/04/silver-linings-in-state-responses-to-covid-19/) by [Jared M. Rhoads](https://www.theobjectivestandard.com/author/jrhoads/)

**Here is an excerpt from the introduction:**

>"As Americans endure a pandemic of COVID-19, there is much to criticize regarding the public health orders that authorities at various levels have issued and the way in which they have issued them. However, a wave of deregulation temporarily is transforming some aspects of state health-care policy for the better. Calling attention to these actions can encourage other states to follow suit now—and increase the chance of achieving permanent deregulation later. Below are five broad areas in which state responses to the COVID-19 crisis have been promising. This is not a comprehensive list, but it illustrates this trend."
