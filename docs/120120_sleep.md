### Live Soundly, Sleep Soundly

More than anything else, I think that what I do while I'm awake determines how well I sleep. I think that those who sleep most soundly, are those who live most soundly. Living soundly means living with purpose and integrity; with values and with moral consistency. Choosing, ranking, and pursuing values is hard work. When I do this all day, I'm tired. The more tired I am at the end of the day, the better I sleep, no matter the conditions. When I fail to pursue my values, or worse, if I act against my values, I don't feel tired, I feel anxious, stressed, and restless. For instance, some days I set a list of tasks that I want to complete, but I decide instead to browse social media under the guise of "networking." I know very well that I'm not doing my work, and at the end of the day, instead of wanting to sleep, I feel the need to stay awake either to finish the work I didn't do, or subconsciously to punish myself for failing to do what I know I should have done.

Besides the mental and physical exhaustion that results from hard work, I'm able to judge myself as having earned my rest when I've done what I set out to do. When I lie down in a dark quiet room, instead of my subconscious mind generating the restlessness that comes from regret, I instead feel relaxed and serene because I pursued my values.

To prove this theory to myself, I performed a thought experiment, or more accurately, I thought back to arguably the most stressful time period of my life -- medical residency. During this three year period, I was under constant stress, I ate poorly, my exercise was lacking, I drank ample caffeine at all hours of the day and night, I switched constantly form day shifts to night shifts, I followed almost zero conventional sleep recommendations, and yet I slept soundly wherever and whenever I wanted. Perhaps this was in part due to sheer physical and mental exhaustion, but that can't account for the whole of it. In fact, I had some rotations during which there was ample time to sleep and I was not exhausted, but I slept well nonetheless because I was working hard at something I loved. There was one brief period during which my sleep suffered, and predictably, this was a period of weeks during which I was very disappointed in my own clinical performance. During this period of fragmented sleep, I was actually on one of the most difficult rotations that allowed me the least possible time to sleep, and so I was the most exhausted I could have been, and yet I couldn't sleep. As soon as I resolved the psychological distress, sleep returned.

There aren't any sleep hacks, supplements, medications, or blue-blockers that will overcome a mind at war with itself. You can take prescription strength sedatives, or drink yourself into a stupor, but not only does this not produce restful sleep, it obviously contributes to the cycle of value destruction and regret that prevented sleep in the first place.

With that said, here are the other factors that affect sleep and some examples of how I manipulate them in an ongoing attempt to optimize my sleep.

### Cognitive Off-loading

For me, this is the single most impactful activity that has made it easier for me to go straight to sleep. I have to shut my day down and make a plan for the next day. Not only does this give me a quiet mind when I hit the pillow, it also sets me up to feel motivated when I wake up in the morning.

This process starts by getting as much done during the day as possible, and whatever is left undone gets scheduled for a specific time in the future.

If I have tasks left over in the evening, I solve this problem by journaling and getting my task lists prepared for the next day. This activity allows my subconscious to relax. I was inspired to do this consistently after reading Cal Newport's book "Deep Work." In the book, he talks about doing a ["shut down"](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2009/06/08/drastically-reduce-stress-with-a-work-shutdown-ritual/) at the end of the work day akin to shutting down your computer.

### Timing

Having a consistent sleep schedule will establish a routine, a pattern, and habits surrounding sleeping and waking that your mind and body will grow accustomed to. The strongest zeitgeber (literally time-giver - or signal to the brain about the time of day), and strongest entrainer of the circadian rhythm, is light. Thus, if it's possible to wake with sunrise and sleep just after sunset, I think this is likely optimal for most people.

I personally have difficulty with this due to the nature of my work, but when possible, I try to stick to a schedule.

### Preparation

Having a routine to deliver bedtime cues to your subconscious can be useful.

Some examples include stretching, reading, listening to a podcast ([my favorite podcast](https://jockopodcast.com/)) or audiobook ([my current audiobook as of July, 2020](https://www.audible.com/pd/Grit-Audiobook/B01D3AC5BA)), or taking a hot shower. Just make sure the activity doesn't conflict with the other recommendations here. I usually listen to a podcast with the sleep timer set to 15 or 30 minutes. Sometimes I do mobility work with a foam roller or a [mobility "peanut."](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A9XPNOQ/ref=as_sl_pc_as_ss_li_til?tag=kornweissmedi-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=bc4a9cd29351079f06dea5563685d27d&creativeASIN=B00A9XPNOQ)

### Light

Sleep experts recommend total darkness in the bedroom and they recommend eliminating blue-light exposure in the evening. Blue-light delays the secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland which is a hormonal signal to the rest of the brain that likely initiates a sensation of fatigue and the drive to sleep.

I aim for darkness in the bedroom, but definitely have a couple very dim LEDs and some outside light that filters into the room that don't seem to bother me. I do use [night shift mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207570) on my Apple devices in the evening, which cuts the blue light out of the screen. I also dim these devices as low as they'll go after sundown. I dim my house lights to minimal brightness and use as few lights as necessary.

Some people really go all out by installing red-spectrum lights in their house and wearing blue-blocking glasses in the afternoon or evening. I've never tried this, but if you have a real problem getting to sleep, this might be worth looking into. Peter Attia, MD, one of my favorite resources on sleep, nutrition, and longevity medicine discusses this at length in multiple places on his [website](https://peterattiamd.com/category/sleep/) and [podcast](https://peterattiamd.com/ama04/). In July, 2020, he recommends [these glasses](https://shopfelixgray.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=G_PS_Brand_Felix_Gray_Priority_B_E_P&utm_adgroup=G_PS_Brand_Felix_Gray_Priority_Brand_Name_E&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI4sf3x9fL6gIVSuDICh225wQ5EAAYASAAEgKc-vD_BwE) from a company called Felix Gray.

I have not tried these myself.

### Temperature

Cooling of the core body temperature may help with sleep initiation.

I sleep at 71 or 72 degrees in the summer on most nights, and in the winter I heat my house to around 65 degrees. I adjust my clothing until I feel comfortable. I have mixed feelings on this one, because I have found that sleeping in warmer temperatures in the summer has helped me acclimatize to the heat and allows me to feel more comfortable outside in hot temperatures. If I sleep at temps consistently cooler than 72, I feel pretty uncomfortable in 98 degrees F during the day.

There is probably a good balance here that can be found on a case-by-case basis. Overall, if you're having trouble getting to sleep and you're also over-heated, cooling the house by a degree or two might be a good step to take. For those who have serious problems overheating at night and need drastically cooler temperatures than their bed-fellow, a cooling pad such as the [Ooler](https://www.chilitechnology.com/products/ooler-sleep-system?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_Yud9pzL6gIVkZOzCh1ClQEJEAAYASAAEgLuVvD_BwE) or [chiliPAD](https://www.chilitechnology.com/products/chilipad-sleep-system) (both Trademarks of Chili) may prove useful. I haven't yet tried either one.

### Food

I try to wrap up meals at least 3 hrs before bed which is essential for those who suffer from acid reflux, but also less obviously, for those who don't. If you need to eat closer to bed time, keep it down to small items and consider eating carbohydrates rather than fat and protein. The reason for this is that it's more metabolically expensive to absorb and digest fat and protein, so eating them generates more heat ([the thermic effect of food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_dynamic_action#Types_of_foods)), increases the heart rate, and will leave your stomach full for a longer period of time.

A personal favorite evening food is a cup of bone broth. It'll take away hunger and may even help with sleep due to its glycine content <sup>[1]</sup>. I've measured my own blood sugar, sleep latency, heart rate, heart rate variability, and sleep disruptions after eating large mixed meals (fat, carbohydrates, and protein) just before bedtime, and there is a major negative effect. My blood sugar stays elevated all night, my heart rate can run 10 beats higher than baseline, my heart rate variability plummets, and I can lose an additional 20-30 minutes of sleep over the course of the night in disruptions. There are several other reasons not to eat close to bedtime that are outside the scope of this article<sup>[2]</sup>.

### Sound

I try to keep it quiet but I actually prefer a bit of white noise which I get from a ceiling fan and an air filter. As an aside, I'm always shocked when I change the filter - bedroom fabrics, pillows, towels, tissues, and carpets produce a seemingly endless supply of dust.

### Caffeine

I have tried to eliminate caffeine almost completely from my diet. When I do choose to drink coffee (which I love), I consume as little as possible and as early as possible in the day.

Some people are slow metabolizers and may still have some circulating caffeine late at night even after a single morning or midday coffee. You may not feel the effects of the caffeine, but that doesn't mean that it isn't keeping you awake. Try to cut back on the quantity and have it as early as possible. If you can stop drinking coffee (and other sources of caffeine) by 9 or 10 am, or earlier, that is ideal. If you find yourself tired in the early afternoon the first couple days, give it a few more days to see if getting more sleep makes up for the decrease in caffeine.

I reliably have a delayed sleep cycle if I drink more than half of a cup of coffee in the morning. Instead of feeling tired around eight or nine PM, I'm wide awake until midnight or later.

### Workouts

I try to perform high intensity workouts early in the day. Even low intensity workouts close to bedtime raise my body temperature and delay my sleep onset. Many people find that high-intensity workouts in the evening keep them up later. I sometimes break my own rule on this one and I usually pay the price.

### Supplements

If you do most of the other things properly most of the time, you probably won't need medications or supplements, almost ever. That said, sometimes you want to ensure a good night's sleep as much as possible, and supplements might help. For those nights, I think [Doc Parsley's Sleep Remedy](https://store.docparsley.com/products/sleep-remedy) is likely safe and effective. It contains a small dose of melatonin which is meant to help with sleep initiation, serotonin, phosphatidylserine, magnesium, and vitamin D. I think it's possible that the serotonin, phosphatidylserine, and magnesium may help with reducing stress and anxiety and therefore may assist with sleep initiation. I am uncertain as to why the vitamin D is included, but I think it's very unlikely to be harmful, and may be helpful for the many people who are vitamin D deficient.
