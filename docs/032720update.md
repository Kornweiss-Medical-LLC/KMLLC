## **Q: Is it helpful to wear a surgical mask?**
A: Almost certainly yes. It's hard to find surgical masks right now, but
if you have them, judicious use of the mask with good quality hand
hygiene is probably quite effective against the virus. The most useful
scenarios are in close contact with other people. The best time to use
the mask would not be in wide open spaces where droplet and aerosol
transmission is unlikely, but in tight enclosed spaces with other
people, especially if these spaces are air conditioned.
[Here](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3074351/coronavirus-can-travel-twice-far-official-safe-distance-and-stay)
is an article written about the spread of Covid-19 on a Chinese bus. It
is speculative and uncontrolled, but potentially instructive in regards
to surgical mask utility and spread of virus on public transit.

## **Q: Can the virus be spread by people without symptoms?**
A: Almost certainly yes. There are several medical publications that use
known cases and their close contacts to demonstrate asymptomatic spread.
[Here](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762028) is one
of them. The logic of such papers goes like this: patient 0 comes from
out of town and spends 2 days with family members and then leaves town
again. On day 3, patient 0 becomes symptomatic and tests positive for
covid-19. The family members are tracked down and subsequently develop
symptoms despite no other known contacts. The only possibility is that
patient 0 became infected prior to visiting and spread the infection
during the asymptomatic period.

## **Q: How does the virus spread?**
A: The primary method appears to be close contact with an infected
individual. Infected individuals secrete viral particles in nasal mucous
(runny nose, sneeze), expectorated sputum (coughing), saliva, and stool.
When an infected individual blows their nose, coughs, or sneezes, tiny
droplets of mucous fly through the air and can land on nearby surfaces,
or your face or hands, or they can be directly inhaled. The virus can
infect the nasal mucosa, the cells in the lungs, or it can get into your
eye directly or by touching a droplet and then touching your eye. The
eye itself does not become infected, but tears wash the droplet into the
tear duct which drains into the nose where infection occurs. Direct
droplet spread and self-inoculation are likely the primary methods of
infection.

### Surfaces

The [viral RNA can definitely be found on
surfaces](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmc2004973) such as
cardboard, plastic, and metal, but to my knowledge, nobody has yet
demonstrated that the presence of RNA on these surfaces is definitively
infectious. Still, it is best to assume that any surface (including
delivered packages) can be contaminated, and to disinfect them to the
best of your ability. 

### Aerosols

The virus may also spread as an airborne aerosol in some circumstances,
but this also has not been proven. Airborne/aerosol spread is different
than droplet spread in terms of the size of the particle and how long
it's suspended in the air. Droplets usually don't make it more than 6
feet away from the source before falling to the ground within seconds to
minutes. Aerosols could stay airborne for hours and travel much further.
Airborne transmission is probably minimal in most conditions -- but is
probably responsible for some subset of transmissions (this might be
especially true in enclosed spaces with turbulent air flow, such as
hospital rooms, and public transit.)

## **Q: What can you do to minimize chances of infection?**
A: [Wear a surgical
mask](https://medium.com/@Cancerwarrior/covid-19-why-we-should-all-wear-masks-there-is-new-scientific-rationale-280e08ceee71),
wash your hands, stay away from infected people. The WHO and CDC are not
[blowing
smoke](https://gizmodo.com/blowing-smoke-up-your-ass-used-to-be-literal-1578620709)
on hand washing. Fastidious hand-hygiene is important. I also strongly
believe that surgical masks are very protective against spreading this
disease. There is a "shortage" of masks, so you might have trouble
buying them right now, but if you already have some, they are best used
to cover the nose and mouth of infected individuals or to protect
oneself in close-contact situations (think public transport, packed
stores, etc.) [IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO CONTAMINATE YOURSELF BY TOUCHING
THE OUTSIDE OF A CONTAMINATED MASK AND THEN
SELF-INOCULATING.](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks) The
reason for confusing mask recommendations is that some healthcare
providers are running out, and a public run on mask supplies would make
it even harder for healthcare personnel to get their hands on masks. So,
authorities are recommending against masks to maintain supply chains.
But, it looks to me like there was a run on masks anyway --- people
generally don't trust a recommendation to not protect themselves. So, if
you have masks, protect yourself. If you have a lot of extra masks,
consider donating them to a major city that is struggling, or a local
hospital that is running short. Call your hospital, they should have
someone responsible for tracking down and obtaining protective gear.

## **Q: Are hospitals over-run?**
A: Some are. At this point, everyone probably knows that many hospitals
in and around NYC are over full-capacity. They are running out of
equipment, ventilators, and ICU beds. If you live in or around a major
city right now, there is a good chance that healthcare resources are
scarce. But, hospitals in more suburban or rural areas have had two plus
weeks to prepare and many of them have seen massive cuts to their usual
volume. Elective surgeries have been cancelled nationally. Routine
outpatient visits have been cancelled. And, anecdotally, it seems like
people are avoiding hospitals as much as possible. So, some hospitals
have far more capacity than usual, but those in many big cities are
swamped, or they're about to be. Even if your local hospital is
well-prepared, this is something that could change quickly. It's very
easy for this virus to [take hold in a nursing
home](https://jamanetwork.com/channels/health-forum/fullarticle/2763666)
or rehab facility and cause people who are already elderly and
chronically-ill to all be infected in a short period of time. Several
dozen of these patients becoming simultaneously ill would easily consume
a major hospital system's critical care resources. The bottom line is
that hospital status is extremely variable right now and depends largely
on your local population density and the preparedness of your local
health system.

## **Q: When will this be over?**
A: Weeks to months -- best case scenario -- 8 weeks (Starting on
3/27/20). At this very moment, if we stopped the spread of the virus, we
would still have two weeks before we would even know that it was
stopped, and likely another two weeks to see how existing cases will
resolve. This means we have at least another month of uncertainty, and
probably more. Many experts are optimistic that our "social distancing"
and warmer weather will slow the spread of the disease, which I think is
likely, but I think we'll see throughout the year bursts of infection as
this virus inevitably finds its way into nursing homes, group homes,
etc. For the average person, I am optimistic that within 6-8 weeks, we
will have a significant national slow-down in spread, robust healthcare
responses and preparation, a solid and wide-spread understanding of
prevention in terms of mask-wearing and hand-hygiene, and a private
sector response in the way of [manufacturing

and supplies.

## **Q: Are there any useful treatments or preventive strategies?**
A: Yes and No. If you're not yet ill or only mildly ill, there are no
treatments other than routine supportive care (antipyretics like
acetaminophen, rest, and fluids). If you're severely (requiring oxygen)
or critically-ill (requiring a ventilator), there are several treatments
being used. Medications -- notably hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin
are being used in hospitals to treat severe cases, but the data on these
treatments are not promising at the moment. Life-threatening side
effects of these medications are real, including sudden-cardiac-death
from malignant arrhythmias.  See below:

The top tracing is a normal heart rhythm. It's called Sinus rhythm.\
The waveform below that is called ventricular tachycardia (v-tach). The
top rhythm reflects an organized firing of the heart's electrical
system, which causes each chamber of the heart to fire sequentially to
maintain normal blood flow. The bottom rhythm shows v-tach, a
life-threatening arrhythmia that in some cases can degenerate and cause
sudden death if the patient does not receive defibrillation quickly.
Below is what the heart looks like when it's shocked out of v-tach into
normal sinus rhythm.

Shock from Vtach to Sinus

It's because of this potentially deadly complication from medications,
along with the propensity of the virus to cause cardiac involvement and
increase the risk of arrhythmia, that doctors are hesitant to recommend
these medications in the absence of strong evidence that they work.

The [mechanism of action of
hydroxychloroquine](https://chrismasterjohnphd.com/are-chloroquine-and-hydroxychloroquine-zinc-ionophores-covid-19-updates)
is thought to be the blockade of endosomal acidification. The endosome
is a membrane bound organelle within the cell that can harbor viral RNA.

![Matthew R G Russell / CC BY

height="357"}

Viral RNA requires certain conditions to travel within the cell and to
replicate. One of these conditions is thought to be a particular pH.
Hydroxychloroquine may inhibit viral replication by increasing the pH of
the endosome, the tiny organelle that houses viral RNA within the cell.
Essentially, the supposed mechanism of this medication is to prevent
viral replication rather than effect the devastating downstream effects
that occur when a patient is critically ill.

So, if the medication is going to work, it probably works best early in
disease when the virus has not yet infected lots of cells. But, early on
in the disease process, symptoms are usually very mild and the most
likely clinical course is recovery (it's possible that as many as 50% of
infected people never develop symptoms at all; of the remaining 50%,
only about 1/3 may go on to develop severe or critical illness). With
odds this good, taking a dangerous medication is usually imprudent
considering the potential side effects, which in some cases can be
deadly.

Other treatments under investigation are: Remdesevir (unavailable unless
you're critically ill), and Kaletra (an HIV med that is very expensive,
potentially dangerous, of limited availability, and of [questionable
efficacy](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001282)). I've
read that vaccines are already in clinical trials, but expert infectious
disease physicians don't think we'll have an effective vaccine for 1+
years, and even then, the first to receive it will likely be healthcare
workers.

So, essentially, there is no known safe and/or effective treatment that
can be taken prophylactically or early in the disease course. Available
treatments, though likely of limited efficacy by the time they are used,
are best used in severely or critically ill patients. I hope this will
change very soon, and it is what I am spending most of my time
researching.

Regarding prevention, the best things you can do are to be fastidious
about distancing, hygiene, mask wearing, nutrition, sleep, and exercise.
Nutrition, sleep, and exercise are incredibly important for immune
function. It's clear that metabolic syndrome (diabetes, hypertension,
obesity, fatty liver, and coronary artery disease) puts people at high
risk of severe complications. It's easy to binge on ice cream when
you're anxious and stressed at home, but don't do it! You're making
yourself less fit and more likely to have a bad complication from
infection in the case that it happens. The better thing to do would be
to exit isolation in a few weeks in the best shape of your life.
