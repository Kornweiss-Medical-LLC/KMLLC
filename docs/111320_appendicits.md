On October 25, 2020, I was seated at my desk at work and noticed a vague but unusual sensation in my abdomen; a few sharp pains cascaded across my lower abdomen and then vanished. It was 10 AM. I evaluated several patients who were waiting for me, and then I made my way to breakfast. I ate eggs, sausage, and hashbrowns, and drank half of a black coffee.

At 11 AM, I felt a mild cramp in my lower abdomen. I believed this was merely a signal to use the restroom. Next, I felt a sharp pain. The pain was deep within my pelvis, it was a sudden, deep, and lancinating pain. It was at this time that I believed something was wrong.

I resumed work, but a few minutes later when I noted that the pain had not receded, I was compelled to examine my own abdomen. I laid flat on a stretcher, and pressed deeply over the right lower part of my abdomen. I encountered a small area that was tender between my umbilicus (belly button) and my right groin, a point known by medical professionals as "McBurney's Point." I surveyed myself and noted the absence of any other symptoms. I did not have nausea, fever, a loss of appetite, or malaise. Besides the pain, which had now dulled, I felt normal. I moved my leg back and forward, walked, squatted, extended at the hip, and I felt no worsening of the pain.

I visited several patients, hoping that the pain would subside. When it didn't, I reexamined myself, carefully noting that the tenderness persisted. I calmly announced to my colleagues, "I think I have appendicitis."

My colleagues looked at me and assessed my degree of seriousness.  They quickly noted my upright posture and relaxed facial expression, and each produced their own version of an eyebrow raise which communicated a collective skepticism.

I worked for five more hours. The pain persisted, but it was quite mild. I felt only a vague dull ache and a sense of heaviness in the right lower part of my abdomen. I felt better when seated, and when I walked, I did not feel pain, but I noticed that I preferred to lean and bend slightly to the right. Walking, rocking back and forth, and bouncing up and down did not increase the pain as it should in advanced appendicitis. Occasionally, I felt a lancinating pain deep within my right pelvis that referred to my bladder and rectum. These shooting pains lasted only for an instant, but they were sufficiently disturbing so as to building waves of shivers across my skin, eventually enveloping the whole of my body before seeming to permeate first my subconscious with a sense of terror, and then my conscious mind with the knowledge that I did likely have appendicitis, and that I would shortly be in the operating room undergoing surgery. I held on to hope of flimsy alternate explanations.

After performing my clinical duties, I proceeded to perform an ultrasound of my own abdomen. The moment I placed the ultrasound probe over the area of tenderness, I visualized a black circle circumscribing a white circle which contained a white dome with black shadowing. I knew this likely represented a loop of bowel containing a hard substance all surrounded by fluid; in other words, I believed I had found an inflamed appendix harboring a stone, called an appendicolith (appendico-lith means, literally, appendix-stone -- appendicoliths typically form when stool enters the appendix and remains stuck there long enough for some hardening and calcification to occur). The appendix is a small loop, or pouch, with a blind end. I followed the loop back and forth with the ultrasound probe, it seemed to end rather than continue on. I now felt my diagnosis inescapable.

Appendicitis is a condition in which the appendix becomes inflamed, and if left untreated, can often rupture, and cause a very serious infection inside of a patient's abdomen, which can result in severe illness and even death, though in countries with modern medicine, death is extraordinarily rare. The treatment for appendicitis is usually surgical removal of the appendix. In some cases, appendicitis can be treated with antibiotics alone. As a physician with a healthy fear of surgery, I wanted to have as much confirmation of the diagnosis as possible before making a treatment decision (In addition, most surgeons prefer a CT scan demonstrating a clear diagnosis of appendicitis before they will operate - especially in uncertain cases).

I was able to obtain a CT scan which confirmed my diagnosis. Not only was my appendix enlarged and inflamed, there was, in fact, an appendicolith within the middle of my appendix.

After the diagnosis was confirmed, I decided to have my appendix removed surgically. Prior to this ordeal, I had always thought that if I had appendicitis, I would choose antibiotics over surgery, but once I learned that my appendix was obstructed by a stone, I decided that the risk of antibiotics failing, and my appendix subsequently rupturing, outweighed the risk of surgery.

If the appendix ruptures, stool and infectious material leak into the abdominal cavity often causing an abscess to form. This usually requires hospitalization and surgical drains, as well as prolonged courses of antibiotics. It can also cause surgery to become more complicated. The healing process from the ruptured appendix can cause adhesions (a form of internal scarring) to form around the bowels, which can lead to future bowel obstructions if loops of bowel become entangled and strangulated by the adhesions. I really did not want this to happen.

On the other hand, I also did not want to lose my appendix. Most people believe that the appendix serves no known function. I remember being taught about vestigial organs in middle school. The appendix was used as an example. But, the appendix may serve a role in gastrointestinal immunity. Some believe that the appendix harbors helpful bacteria that can repopulate the colon after a bout of infectious diarrhea  [^1]. The appendix is also associated with immune tissue that some believe is an integral part of gastrointestinal immunity. Additionally, at least one study has found an association between appendectomy and an increased risk of colorectal cancer [[2]], while another did not [[3]]. Despite these concerns, 5-10% of Americans will undergo appendectomy every year, and these individuals seem to do quite well on the average. The last concern, which goes for any surgery, is of course the risk of surgical complications.

After speaking with the surgeon, I was brought to the pre-operative area. I reflected upon my symptoms. Where was the textbook pain of appendicitis that typically starts at the umbilicus (belly button), and which gradually migrates to the right lower quadrant? As I thought, I recalled the prior two nights. At the time, I thought nothing of it, but I remembered that the night before, I had been pushing on my umbilicus reflexively. I made nothing of it at the time. Even now, I would not describe the sensation I felt as pain, just perhaps a very vague and fleeting ache. I did also have a burning epigastric pain that I thought was acid reflux which lasted an hour or two, but subsided. It was the first and last time I've experienced such a sensation in my life. I awoke multiple times throughout the night feeling overheated and restless. I was never nauseated. I did not vomit. I did not feel as though I had a fever or chills, but in retrospect, there were vague signs that likely marked the beginning of the inflammatory process.

As I finished my reflecting, the anesthetist entered. While surgery is performed by a surgeon, the surgeon's job would be far more difficult, and the surgery a great ordeal without the under-appreciated anesthesiologist. Before my operation, I met my anesthesiologist.

I asked her for the anesthesia plan, which included a series of medications starting with analgesics (pain medications), antiemetics (nausea medications), and followed by a sedative/anxiolytic (relaxation medications).

There are three major categories of analgesics:
    
Narcotics
        
    This category includes medications like oxycodone, morphine, fentanyl and hydromorphone. My anesthesiologist was planning to use fentanyl. This drug works almost instantly after it's administered through an IV, but usually wears off within 30-120 minutes depending on the individual and the dose given.
    
NSAIDS (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)
        
    This category includes medications like ibuprofen, naproxen, and ketorolac. My anesthesiologist was planning to use ketorolac. Ketorolac is an effective pain medicine that has no habit-forming (addicting) properties, and does not make the patient feel sedated in any way. It also has antiinflammatory properties. It's used frequently for renal colic (the pain from kidney stones and kidney infections), and also often for gynecologic pathology, and musculoskeletal injuries.
    
Acetaminophen
        
    Acetaminophen, or Tylenol, is often used for analgesia and as an anti-pyretic (temperature/fever reducer). In the operating room, anesthesiologists will sometimes use intravenous Tylenol to treat pain. My anesthesiologist planned to use this as well.

I was in very little pain, and I wanted to experience post-operative pain for the purposes of educating myself and others without these medications in my system. I refused all three, but I relented on the IV Tylenol. I did not take or receive any other pain medications before, during, or after my surgery besides this one dose of IV Tylenol, nor did I feel it was necessary at any time. This may not be true for others who might have varying degrees of inflammation or a different experience with pain than I did.

There are many different antiemetic drugs. My anesthesiologist wanted to use one of the most common, which is called ondansetron (Zofran). I turned this down as well, as I did not experience any nausea. Sometimes steroid medications are used to treat nausea as well, and I did agree to receive a dose of IV dexamethasone to avoid post-anesthesia nausea.

Last, it's common to receive a dose of sedative/anxiolytic such as midazolam (also known as Versed, a member of the class of medications called benzodiazepines) pre-operatively. These drugs work similarly to alcohol on a biochemical level, and similarly result in slowed thinking, slurred speech, decreased anxiety, and eventually a sedated state. I turned this down as well, as I very much wanted the full experience of being aware of and remembering the moments leading up to general anesthesia.

So, I was not the most agreeable patient. But, when a doctor has another doctor as a patient, this is expected, within reason.

Next, my very gracious and patient anesthesiologist explained that I would undergo general anesthesia. This means I would be fully unconscious. There are many medications that can render a patient completely unconscious, but one of the most common is a drug familiar to those who remember Michael Jackson's tragic death. This drug is called propofol. When used in proper doses under monitored circumstances, or in the context of general anesthesia when the patient will be connected to a ventilator, this is actually an incredibly safe drug with a nearly non-existent side-effect profile. The medication itself has a unique appearance 
it is a milky white substance. The drug mixture has this appearance because the drug itself is lipophilic. Remember from high-school chemistry and biology that this means the chemical is "fat loving," it dissolves well in fat. The mixture is a lipid emulsion (just like a hollandaise sauce) the drug is dissolved with a fatty liquid that looks like milk. The drug is given through an IV line, and its ability to dissolve well in fat allows it to very rapidly cross into brain tissue and bind to receptors that render the patient unconscious (these receptors are again the same kind that are affected by drinking alcohol or taking sedative medications).

Depending on the dose of the drug given, the patient may continue to breathe on their own, even though they are completely unconscious. Next, a paralytic drug is delivered through the IV which stops the patient from moving and relaxes all of their muscles. This is very good for surgery, because it prevents the patient from moving while the surgeon is operating, but, it also stops the patient from breathing by paralyzing the muscles in the chest cavity, including the diaphragm, which are responsible for breathing. To address this problem, and for another reason I'll explain momentarily, the anesthesiologist has to breathe for the patient.

This is done by using a laryngoscope (a special tool that opens the patient's airway) 
to assist with the insertion of an endotracheal tube (a plastic tube that goes inside the trachea). Once the tube is in place, it's connected to an anesthesia machine. This machine is a special ventilator which allows the anesthesiologist to control the breathing rate, depth of the breath, and the amount of oxygen going to the patient. The machine can also deliver inhaled anesthetics, which are used to keep the patient unconscious throughout the procedure. The propofol which is given initially is quickly metabolized, so that, unless it is given continuously, or in repeat doses, the patient would otherwise regain consciousness within several minutes depending on the dose and patient specific conditions such as weight and metabolic rate.

Because I didn't accept any sedatives in the pre-op area, I remember being wheeled in to the OR, talking to my OR team, and breathing in oxygen and inhaled anesthetic through the mask. I remember trying to crack a joke while the anesthesiologist dosed me with propofol. The next thing I remember is waking up in the post-op area. This is the goal of the anesthesiologist
to keep the patient alive throughout surgery and to make sure they don't remember anything that happened. This is easier said than done, though experienced anesthetists certainly make it look easy.

In the emergency department, we use similar medications for bedside procedures, but we must be cautious with our dosing, because we do not endeavor to connect our patients to ventilators. So, we must dose medications adequately to ensure patient comfort, but not to the degree that they cease to breathe spontaneously.

While I was asleep, my surgeon carried out a laparoscopic appendectomy.

He first made an incision on my abdominal wall just beneath my umbilicus (belly button). He then dissected down through the fat until he reached the peritoneum (this is a layer of tissue that encloses the abdominal cavity and all of the organs inside). Usually, the surgeon will lift upward on the peritoneum and make a tiny incision, large enough to insert a hollow plastic tube, called a port. Through the port he can insert a camera, and a machien that insufflates (inflates) the abdominal cavity with air. The abdomen inflates upwards like a balloon, making space between the abdominal wall and the bowels and organs so that the surgeon can insert tools and have space to work. Two more holes are made in the abdominal wall for a total of three. This makes room for a camera and two tools usually an assistant drives the camera while the surgeon operates the tools.  Blunt graspers are used to move the bowels in order to expose the appendix, which in my case was anterior, superficial, pointing downwards and located within the peritoneum. Lucky for me, this is ideal. It means that the appendix is easily found, easily visualized, and less likely to cause complications. The appendix can point in almost any direction up, down, to either side, and it can be partially located behind the colon and partially or fully outside of the peritoneal cavity. All of these variations could make surgery slightly more complicated than was my case.

Once the appendix is located, the surgeon still has to separate it from any adjacent loops of bowel and connective tissue by cauterizing (burning) and pulling it away. Once the appendix is fully dissected and separated from other tissues, it can be cut away from the bowel. This can be done in numerous ways, but most commonly it is now done using a tool that cauterizes the bowel and delivers a line of special staples across the base of the appendix 
this simultaneously separates the appendix from the bowel and closes the remaining appendiceal stump all at once.

Then, the appendix is removed through one of the three ports, the abdomen deflated, the ports removed, the tiny incisions (each about an inch long) are closed with suture and glue, and the surgery is concluded.

As the procedure is nearing its end, the surgeon will notify the anesthetist who will turn off the inhaled anesthetic and gives an IV drug to reverse the paralysis. Once the patient is breathing on their own, the anesthetist will remove the breathing tube. This is an extremely important and delicate process that anesthetists do routinely, but which is not to be taken for granted.

Once the patient is extubated (breathing tube is removed) they are brought to the post-op area where nurses will monitor the patient until they have been stable for 30-60 minutes.

In my case, I went home after this monitoring period. I was mildly sore, but completely lucid, and felt very well rested.

For the next seven days, I nursed myself back to health. I checked my incisions every day for signs of infection, like worsening pain, redness, or tenderness. I took pictures of them daily so that I could compare one day to the next. I used a stool softener called polyethylene glycol twice a day. On the third day after surgery, I regained normal bowel function (it is normal to have decreased bowel function for 2-3 days after an abdominal operation). I walked every day for at least 30 minutes, but usually more than an hour. I slept, a lot. And, I ate healthy food; eggs, rice, meat, bits of bread and vegetables, and fish.  I drank plenty of water, some tea, and a little bit of coffee. I did not take any medication at all. My abdomen felt swollen and heavy, and I often had sharp pains deep within my abdomen. This improved a little bit each day.  The pain was never so bad that it was intolerable, but it was scary. I worried that something was still wrong every time I felt pain.

On day six, I received a message from the hospital. A pathologist examined my appendix. Pathologists are specially trained doctors who examine biopsies (tissue samples) and who also perform whole autopsies (examination of dead people) to find out what is (or was) wrong. The pathologist determined that I definitely had appendicitis. This determination is made by looking at the appendix with the naked eye, and by examining thin slices of the appendix under a microscope.

By the seventh day, I was able to sit up and down with ease. I had little to no pain, but still did not feel 100% normal. By day eight, I was able to work with no problems.

I learned a lot from this experience:
    
**Being a doctor doesn't make being a patient any less frightening.**
    
Having surgery was, and still is, one of my biggest fears. As an emergency physician, I only see patients after an operation if something goes wrong. Most patients do not have complications from surgery, because most surgeons are very good at what they do. These patients do not come to the ER, because they do well and follow-up in surgery clinics. I only see patients who do poorly, and so, my professional view of surgery is colored in this way. 
    
I know that an appendectomy is one of the simplest operations, and that mine in particular was extremely straightforward. But, I cannot help but think that every post-op twinge and pain is from an abscess, a hernia, or some other disaster that will ultimately lead to complication after complication. Because of my profession, I can quite rapidly invoke mental images of cascades of surgical and medical disasters resulting in my disability or demise. For those who work outside the medical profession, the terror might be even worse, because the unknown can be scariest of all. I can make reasonable interpretations of my pain. But for those without medical training, the imagination could run wild. Doctors do well when they recognize that most patients just want to understand what's going on. People don't expect miracles and omniscience, but they do expect reasonable explanations of diagnoses and best guesses at prognosis.
    
**The diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis seems routine, but it's complex, and not to be taken for granted.**
    
There were six doctors involved in my care, two CT technologists, at least six nurses, and several other assistants. Each doctor goes through at least seven years of post graduate training (after college) in many cases it's actually nine years or more. Nurses go through nursing school. Technologists have specialized training as well. Modern technological marvels like CT scanners, which are now common place even in the smallest hospitals, were not widely available at all hours of the day in most hospitals just fifty years ago. Even when they were available, wait times were much longer, image quality much poorer, radiologists less available, and thus the liklihood of a missed, uncertain, or delayed diagnosis by today's standards was much higher. 
    
Today, we can usually obtain CT scans within an hour of a patient entering one of our ER rooms and have a report thirty minutes later. That is truly unbelievable. Consider the IV contrast media that is injected into your veins which enables the radiologist to see areas of increased and decreased blood flow and thus to find pathological inflammation, or in other cases, blood clots, for example. This contrast media has been improved over the years to decrease allergic reactions, to decrease harm to the kidneys, and in almost every case, this chemical which lights up brightly on CT scans, passes harmlessly through your body and is urinated into the toilet. This is taken completely for granted, but not that long ago, it was common that this contrast media would do harm to your body. And, prior to that, it didn't exist at all.
    
Blood work is usually resulted within thirty minutes of hitting the lab. The lab alone is a modern marvel with machines that can process tens or hundreds of blood samples in the time it would have taken a human to manually process a single sample.
    
In addition to the training and technology, it's easy to forget about the continuing education that physicians complete on a regular basis, and the case discussions that take place between colleagues. Physicians are constantly working to become better diagnosticians; to make every last diagnosis. As a testament to this, consider that in researching this article, I read a Treatise on Appendicitis that was written in 1900. In this treatise, I learned that in certain anatomic variants, the cecum (the part of the bowel that joins the small and large bowels), can sometimes be located near the midline of the abdomen instead of in the right lower quadrant. In these cases, the appendix can project across the midline, and cause pain on the left side of the abdomen. I was not taught about this in school or in training at any time (at least not that I remember).
    
In addition to the diagnostic knowledge and technology that consistently improves, consider the hospital facility which has to be built efficiently and maintained by dozens or hundreds of staff members. Consider the sterile processing department, an oft forgotten department that ensures the sterility of every tool that goes inside of your body during surgery. Consider the purchasing department which ensures the surgeon has the proper suture material, and that the proper medications are available for the anesthesiologist. Consider the pharmacy, where more trained professionals work to purchase, mix, dispense, and monitor the medications being delivered to hundreds of patients throughout the hospital. And, don't forget the hospital administrators who manage and oversee the operation, and make strategic decisions to ensure that the hospital can continue to pay the salaries of its many workers and to stay open to treat its many paying customers.
    
The patient doesn't see most of these people and doesn't have any idea what goes on in these departments. It's easy for medical professionals to take them for granted too.
    
But, we shouldn't, because tiny mistakes in diagnosis or treatment, or just bad luck, such as an allergy to a medication, can cause injury or death. If someone doesn't follow proper sterile processing procedures, or doesn't measure medications properly in the pharmacy, serious complications can occur. It takes a huge group of highly trained experts who stand on the shoulders of the brilliant men and women who came before us to run a safe and effective hospital.
    
**It feels bad when your doctor doesn't listen to you.**
    
I left this out of the story, but while I was working, I told a colleague that I thought I had appendicitis and asked him to examine me. He did not think that I had appendicitis because I wasn't in very much pain, and I wasn't very tender on my examination. I caught a glimpse of what it would feel like to be disregarded by your physician. In my case, it didn't matter much, because I was both patient and doctor, and I was fairly certain of my own diagnosis. And, in all fairness to this other doctor, he knew from the outset that I was going to have a CT scan. So, this is not a true example of a patient being ignored by his doctor, but it was enough to give me a slice of the experience. It was a good reminder that, doctors, like everyone else, sometimes don't listen adequately. When a patient tells me something is wrong, I believe them, and now with renewed vigor. Mistakes, misdiagnoses, and missed diagnoses can happen no matter how hard a doctor tries, but the majority are avoidable by merely listening intently to patients.

[Sir William Osler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Osler), Canadian Physician, one of four founding professors of Johns Hopkins Hospital, who has frequently been described as the Father of Modern Medicine and one of the "greatest diagnosticians ever to wield a stethoscope." [[4]], said "Listen to your patient, he is telling you the diagnosis." In my case, this was literally true. But, when Osler said this, what he meant was that when patients describe their symptoms, they are giving the doctor clues to their diagnosis. It is the doctor's job to listen very carefully, to interpret what the patient says, and most of all, to think deeply. The physician who disregards or fails to hear a patient's symptoms puts both the patient and themselves in great peril.
    
**Doctors are human.**
    
I did not know my anesthesiologist, nurses, or surgeon very well before surgery, but I did know them a little bit, and I believe that I likely enjoyed an extra degree of attentiveness and care on their part as a result of being their colleague and of generally being reasonably well liked (to the best of my knowledge). Most medical professionals work attentively and professionally regardless of who the patient is, but it is undeniable that being in the good graces of your medical team is better than the alternative. Suffice it to say, you do not want an adversarial relationship with your nurse or your doctor. At the very least, any interpersonal strain between a patient and their medical team could detract time and energy from the team who would otherwise be focused solely on delivering the best possible medical care.
    
**Good health begets good health.**

I reinforced what I already knew about health. One important reason to optimize my health on a daily basis is to cope with unexpected challenges like this. I thought because of my good nutrition, metabolic, and gastrointestinal health that I would never have appendicitis. But, I got it anyway. As it turns out, the majority of people who develop appendicitis actually report having regular bowels. The good news is that my body was prepared for an insult. What if I had not been in good health? What might have been different?

I may not have been able to examine my abdomen or ultrasound it easily if I was not reasonably thin, which might have delayed my diagnosis. A delayed diagnosis could have resulted in a ruptured appendix. It would have been more difficult for the nurse to insert an IV to draw blood and administer medications if I did not have lean arms and well hydrated veins. My surgeon may have had more trouble accessing my abdomen to perform surgery, and the operation may have been more difficult if I had more visceral fat (fat around my bowels and internal organs). My wounds and bowels might have recovered more slowly if I had poor nutrition, ongoing inflammation, or an inability to be active after surgery.  I might have suffered a wound infection if I had high blood sugar levels, or unhealthy blood vessels. I might have developed pneumonia or blood clots. My anesthesiologist might have had more difficulty placing a breathing tube and dosing my anesthesia. I might have stayed in the operating room longer and in the hospital longer to recover from anesthesia if I was overweight (some anesthetics are absorbed by fat cells and take longer to leave the body of patients with more fat tissue). Poor nutritional status and lack of abdominal wall musculature could predispose to hernias that could require a second operation.

I could go on with these examples. The point is, if there is no other reason, consider optimizing your health because, one day it may mean the difference between life and death when you require a routine operation, or contract an infection like Covid-19 or the next strain of influenza.

### How did I recover from surgery?

There are a few trite recommendations that you'll hear doctors enumerate for nearly every condition. They're also the same things you'll hear from your family and friends. These recommendations are so general and commonplace, that they're often under-weighted or ignored completely, but they shouldn't be.

How many times have you been told to "get plenty of rest, drink lots of water, and be active, but not too active?"

Because this advice is repeated so often, and is usually unquantified, it sounds unimportant, but it is crucial.

### Sleep
I did sleep a lot. I slept more than fourteen hours the first day after surgery, and twelve hours the next. I slept at least eight hours a night for the next two or three days after that. I think a decent way to think about how much to sleep when ill or recovering from surgery, is simply not to limit your sleep the way we usually do with imposed schedules and alarms, if possible. Allow your body to regulate your sleep naturally.

### Hydration 
I hydrated by drinking enough to make me urinate a full bladder of clear to light-yellow urine every 2-4 hours while awake. If I went longer than that without the urge to urinate, or when I urinated it was less than a "full bladder," or had a dark yellow color, I drank more. Hydrating cannot be done with just plain water, especially when you are not eating enough food, which is common during illness or after surgery. If you have normal kidneys, hydration is best achieved with adequate salt (sodium-chloride) intake. Other electrolytes like potassium and magnesium can be helpful as well. I have several products on my website that I use for hydration.

### Activity
It's extremely important to walk after surgery. I really didn't feel like getting off of the couch. I forced myself to walk 30-60 minutes per day, though. Walking helps recover bowel function, it also decreases the risk of developing blood clots and pneumonia, and it can prevent a decline in cardiopulmonary fitness. I was shocked by my degree of exhaustion and how quickly I became de-trained after surgery. Walking is essential for rehabilitation.

If you've had surgery, you'll know that you are usually given certain lifting and movement restrictions. I was restricted to lifting five pounds for the first two weeks, for example, and then given a taper of lifting restrictions until I can resume unlimited activity eight weeks after my surgery. These restrictions are not arbitrary, they are to prevent sutures from tearing through the thin tissues that line the abdominal cavity, and thus to prevent hernias and other complications. Following these restrictions to the letter is prudent.
