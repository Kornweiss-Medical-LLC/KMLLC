Sadly, there are still many physicians who won't order lab tests at your request. There are a few reasons for this, some of which I’ve previously discussed in a Facebook [post](https://www.facebook.com/stevenkornweissmd/posts/188798642704956). Fortunately, you're no longer dependent upon such physicians. Direct-to-consumer labs are available at affordable prices, and there is an increasing array of options. In this article I explain two of my favorites. At the end, I compare my lab prices with these direct-to-consumer options and explain how labs work within my practice.

## Ownyourlabs.com

One of my favorite options is [ownyourlabs.com](https://ownyourlabs.com/shop-oyl/), which was created by [Dave Feldman](https://twitter.com/DaveKeto) and [Siobhan Huggins](https://twitter.com/siobhan_huggins), two citizen scientists who specialize in the lipidology of the ketogenic diet. You can see their interesting work at [cholesterolcode.com](https://cholesterolcode.com/). When you shop for labs on ownyourlabs.com, you'll not only receive excellent prices, you'll also be able to contribute your anonymized test results to their research database if you desire. With ownyourlabs.com, you'll be able to select and pay for tests online, print your lab order form, find your nearest Labcorp, and receive your tests results via Labcorp's online portal. No doctor needed.

Here are some sample prices from their site:

| Analyte | Price |
| ------ | ----- |
| CBC                               | $7.35  |
| CMP                               | $8.75  |
| Lipid Panel                       | $8.75  |
| Hemoglobin A1c                    | $7.70  |
| Vitamin D,25-Hydroxy              | $44.28 |
| C-Reactive Protein, Cardiac       | $23.10 |
| Insulin                           | $12.60 |
| Lipoprotein(a)                    | $30.80 |
| TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) | $11.55 |

For anyone familiar with lab pricing, you'll know these are excellent prices. If you agree to submit your anonymized data for research, you'll get a 10% discount. The only other fees are a $5.60 fee for venipuncture (blood draw) and $0.25 Paypal checkout fee. Once you pay, you will not get hit with any additional bills later.

## Pixel by Labcorp

Another option is [pixel by Labcorp](https://www.pixel.labcorp.com/). Pixel works nearly the same way as ownyourlabs.com, and is owned by Labcorp. You'll choose and pay for tests online, go to a Labcorp patient service center for collection, and then access your results online. The only difference is that for some tests, Pixel also sells at-home kits for at-home lab collection.

Pixel is more expensive than ownyourlabs.com. Here are some sample prices

| Analyte | Price |
|---------|------|
| Women's Panel - CBC, CMP, Lipid Panel, A1c, TSH, Urinalysis              | $190 |
| Men's Panel - CBC, CMP, Lipid Panel, A1c, Total Testosterone, Urinalysis | $199 |

These prices do not compare favorably to ownyourlabs.com. In fact, the Women's Panel less the urinalysis would be nearly one quarter the price at ownyourlabs.com. Here is the calculation:

| Analyte | Price |
|---------|--------|
| CBC                                                                          | $7.35  |
| CMP                                                                          | $8.75  |
| Lipids                                                                       | $8.75  |
| A1c                                                                          | $7.70  |
| TSH                                                                          | $11.55 |
| Venipuncture                                                                 | $5.60  |
| Paypal Fee                                                                   | $0.25  |
| **Total**                                                                        | $49.95 |
| Total with 10% discount for submitting your anonymized lab data for research | $45.54 |

## How does this compare to labs in my practice?

**Cost**

Membership in my practice does not include the cost of third-party services like labs and imaging. My clients enjoy very low wholesale pass-through pricing on labs, or at their request labs can be submitted for reimbursement by health insurance.

**Accessibility**

I order labs as I see fit, which usually includes twice yearly individualized lab analysis which might include a CBC, CMP, fasting insulin level, CRP, TSH, urinalysis, homocysteine, Lipid panel, direct LDL, Apo B, and any additional labs that pertain to the health of an individual client. My clients can request any lab they’re interested in and I will price it for them and advise on whether or not I think it will be helpful. Ultimately, it is their choice whether or not we order the test. When traveling, patients can request labs and have them done at any Labcorp or Quest in the country.

**Prices**
Here are just a few examples of lab prices in my practice:

| Analyte                     | Price  |
|-----------------------------|--------|
| CBC                         | $2.00  |
| CMP                         | $3.40  |
| Lipid Panel                 | $2.50  |
| A1c                         | $2.25  |
| TSH                         | $2.50  |
| Urinalysis, complete        | $1.40  |
| Lp(a)                       | $7.50  |
| Vitamin D, 25-hydroxy       | $11.00 |
| C-reactive protein, Cardiac | $5.00  |
| Insulin                     | $3.50  |
| Venipuncture                | Free   |
| Additional Charges          | None   |

**The equivalent of the Pixel Women's Panel would cost my client $14.05** as against Pixel's price of $190 or ownyourlabs.com price of $45.54.

**The Process**
When labs are ordered for one of my clients, an electronic order is placed, labs can be drawn and run at any Labcorp patient service center in the country, and results are delivered and interpreted by me at no additional charge. I provide in-depth analysis by tabulating and graphing my client’s lab results. You can see an [example](https://kornweissmedical.com/case-report-fha/) of how affordable, accessible, and carefully interpreted labs helped one of my clients cure her FHA.

**Results**

My clients can also use the [Labcorp patient portal](https://patient.labcorp.com/) to see their results. For clients who don't live near a Labcorp, or who need a test that Labcorp does not offer, I have accounts with several major national labs including Quest and Genova, and several local labs in the Greenville, SC area where my practice is based.
