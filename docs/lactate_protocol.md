# Lactate Testing

**Device and Equipment**
- [Buy](https://lactateplusmeter.store/) Lactate Plus Meter
- I recommend buying the Unstik Comfort lancets that they sell on their website. It’s a comfortable lancet at a very reasonable price.
- Other items you’ll need:
	- Alcohol swabs
	- Cotton balls

**Measuring Blood Lactate Using the Lactate Plus Meter**
- Instructions for Using Lactate Meter ([Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5Rnjo7mNsc&authuser=0), [Lactate Plus Instructions](https://www.novabiomedical.com/lactate-plus/))

1. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water.
2. Dry hands.
3. Clean with alcohol swab.
4. Obtain a droplet of blood using Unistik lancet
5. Gently milk/squeeze 2 drops of blood and wipe them away using a cotton ball or similar.
6. Measure the third drop.

**Protocol to find Zone-2 Using a Stationary Bicycle or Trainer**
1. Over a 10 minute period on your trainer, cycle at a comfortable cadence (suggested 65-80 rpm) and adjust the resistance upward gradually until you're at a difficulty that feels strenuous, but for which you’re certain you can maintain for at least 1 hour.
2. Heart rate will be between 120-150 for most people in this zone.
3. You should be able to comfortably carry on a phone conversation, but you’ll require a breath in between every sentence or two.
4. If you’re unable to converse comfortably, you’re cycling too intensely.
5. If you’re having to slow down, you’re cycling too intensely.
6. Continue at this pace for 45-60 minutes
3. Get off the bike
4. Measure blood lactate
5. Record parameters: resistance setting, cadence, power, heart rate, duration, lactate, rating of perceived exertion.
6. Lactate should be between 1.7-1.9 mmol/L
7. If lactate is greater than 2 mmol/L, decrease the resistance 

**Protocol to find Zone-2 Using a Treadmill**
1. Set the treadmill to a brisk but comfortable walking pace.
2. For most individuals, this will range from 2.5-3.5 mph.
3. Start at a 6% incline, and increase the incline by 1% every minute until the incline feels steep enough that it’s slowing you down or causing a feeling of muscular fatigue.
4. Drop down 1-2% below this incline.
5. For most individuals, this will be between 8-16%
3. You should be able to comfortably carry on a phone conversation, but breathing in between every sentence or two.
4. If you’re unable to converse comfortably, you’re cycling too intensely.
5. If you’re having to slow down, you’re cycling too intensely.
6. Continue at this pace for 45-60 minutes
3. Get off the treadmill.
4. Immediately measure blood lactate
5. Record parameters: incline, speed, heart rate, duration, lactate, rating of perceived exertion.
6. Lactate should be between 1.7-1.9 mmol/L


**Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE)**
Definition: [RPE](https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/measuring/exertion.htm)

- Scale is from 6-20
- 6 = no exertion at all
- 9 = very light
- 11 = light
- 13 = somewhat hard
- 15 = hard (heavy)
- 17 = very hard
- 19 = extremely hard
- 20 = maximal effort
