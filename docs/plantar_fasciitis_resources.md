**Causes of Plantar Fasciitis**
- Tight gastrocnemius or soles muscles that limit ankle mobility and create tension on the plantar fascia.
- Restrictive footwear that doesn’t allow for activation of the muscles of the foot.
- Asymmetric gait due to weakness of the gluteus medius
- - Asymmetric gait or restricted rotation due to limitations of thoracic spine mobility.

**Footwear**

This is an individualized issue, but in general, I am an advocate for zero drop, or low drop shoes which are [thought](https://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/a-1908-8867) to increase the strength of foot muscles. I also prefer shoes with wide toe-boxes. The forefoot [needs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7944704/) a wide toe box so that the toes can spread out and the muscles of the great toe can be used in the propulsion or “toe off” phase of the gait cycle.

There are many options on the market. I like [Xero](https://xeroshoes.com/?gc_id=1056237749&kw=xero%20shoes&cpn=1056237749&utm_campaign=&utm_content=search_brand&gclid=CjwKCAjwwL6aBhBlEiwADycBIDUxnl9W1NmKUammyiVj1_hVlNfvqGlOuP3oBrbGX1sJ5hdMUsbgKhoCl5IQAvD_BwE) shoes and [Converse](https://www.converse.com/shop/wide-width-shoes) (which come in wide widths), but finding the right footwear may require trial and error.
