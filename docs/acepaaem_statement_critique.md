ACEP-AAEM Joint Statement on Physician Misinformation
Joint Statement issued on April 27, 2020:

> The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine (AAEM) jointly and emphatically condemn the recent opinions released by Dr. Daniel Erickson and Dr. Artin Massihi. 

I know you're proud of this language, but the use of their own word "emphatically" is a cheap shot. It sounds immature and people will catch on to that.

> These reckless and untested musings...

An over-reach considering the breadth and depth of the "musings" in the video. Are we really disputing that the death rates are lower than predicted? Are we disputing that curves are flattening? Are we disputing that health care systems are 50% empty rather than over-run? Even their claim that social isolation is bad for immunity has support in the literature - not in the way they explained it, but in other ways. So, while these guys made a lot of bad mistakes, I don't think we can dismiss the entirety as reckless musings.

> do not speak for medical societies and are inconsistent with current science and epidemiology regarding COVID-19. As owners of local urgent care clinics, it appears these two individuals are releasing biased, non-peer reviewed data to advance their personal financial interests without regard for the publicâ€™s health.

As urgent care owners they are positioned to see a subset of covid-19 patients. This is an advantage. Besides, if you focus on their bias as urgent care owners and try to delegitimize them on this basis, there is no basis with which you can legitimize yourself. We are ER doctors - so if our argument is urgent care docs are too biased then aren't we biased as ER docs? Perhaps in some other way, but everyone has an interest in living, having a successful career, etc. This is not a crime and it is not a valid attack on an argument. It's an attack on the individual rather than on their argument. Ownership in a business is not the measure of correctness, but rather the facts of their argument -- even if that business relies on the success of their argument.

> COVID-19 misinformation is widespread and dangerous. 

Exactly. And the worst perpetrators are government officials and the very "experts" that are supposed to protect us. Case in point is your PPE statement against the disgusting CDC which during every epidemic/pandemic declares that some minimal PPE is necessary and then show up on the news in full hazmat.  It's a farce at this point. These are the people who we should scrutinize. These two docs, if they are the clowns that many other docs estimate them to be, will fade. Let them fail on their demerits if they're so wrong.

> Members of ACEP and AAEM are first-hand witnesses to the human toll that COVID-19 is taking on our communities. 

No, we're not. We're first-hand witnesses in most cases of a handful of people getting sick and dying. Most ER docs are not seeing what is being seen in NYC or a few other hot spots. I have a busy 300 patient/per day regional ER and I've personally only cared for a couple dozen Covid cases, only a couple of which have been critically ill. Besides, this is a tiny number compared to the masses affected by lockdowns - which is everyone! Sick or not.

> ACEP and AAEM strongly advise against using any statements of Drs. Erickson and Massihi as a basis for policy and decision making.

This last part is unreasonable as well, because many docs including yourself have said they actually agree with the conclusion, the essence of the urgent care doc's video which was to eliminate lockdowns. So - if the problem is with details and medical/epidemiologic/immunology/etc facts - then why not support the essence of their message and point out that their rationale is wrong and dangerous - then provide corrections.

More coming...
