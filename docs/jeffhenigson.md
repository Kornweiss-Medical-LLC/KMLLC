### The Story of Jeff Henigson
Jeff Henigson was diagnosed with brain cancer at the age of fifteen. He was told the cancer would kill him within a few years. Thirty-five years later, Jeff’s miraculous and fascinating survival [story](https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-52763560) was published online. After his story became public, he was contacted by a neuropathologist.

Here is part of their conversation as [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2021/03/26/my-life-was-upended-35-years-by-cancer-diagnosis-doctor-just-told-me-i-was-misdiagnosed/) in *The Washington Post*:

*“I felt compelled to reach out because it is simply so unusual that you survived anaplastic astrocytoma.”*

“So I’ve been told.” I’d seen dozens of neurologists over the years at some of the top medical institutions on both U.S. coasts. They had all said essentially the same thing. The average life expectancy for a brain tumor like mine was two to three years.

*“And yet despite this being extraordinary, you nevertheless believe that this is what you have managed to survive?”*

My head jerked back. “Excuse me?”

*“I am asking you.”*

I was close to hanging up. “What exactly are you asking me?” I said.

*“I am sorry. I am perhaps not clear. English is not my first language.” He paused. “May I share a story with you?”*

I sighed and rolled my eyes. “Tell me your story.”

I highly recommend reading the [article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2021/03/26/my-life-was-upended-35-years-by-cancer-diagnosis-doctor-just-told-me-i-was-misdiagnosed/) in full. It’s a powerful story that gives you a tiny glimpse of what it’s like to live with a deadly diagnosis. It’s an expose of the dangers of a medical system that is built upon paternalistic roots. It’s a cautionary tale that will teach you the necessity of reading your own medical records, questioning everything, and assuming nothing.

### How to Get Your Own Records

If you go to a doctor, lab, hospital, or imaging center, you can and should request your records in full including all results, physician and nursing notes, and ***imaging on disc***. You may have to physically find the health information management department, medical records department, or radiology library. Many hospitals will now be providing easy digital access to physician and nursing notes due to a new government mandated initiative called “[open notes](https://www.opennotes.org/onc-federal-rule/).” This should make it easier for you to review your physician’s notes without having to track down your records via faxes and snail mail.

### Third-Party Medical Record Retrieval and Digitization Service
I’m testing a new service from a company called [PicnicHealth](https://picnichealth.com/). Their [web service](https://app.picnichealth.com/onboard/account/get-started) will collect, digitize, and tabulate all of your medical records, labs, and actual imaging. The initial fee is $300. You sign a records release consent form and submit the names of the hospitals, labs, and doctors that you’ve visited in the past. In most cases, a partial name and location is all that’s needed for PicnicHealth’s team to track down your records. There is a $39/month fee that is used to keep your records up to date. Apparently this can be cancelled at any time. They advertise record retrieval and digitization within 4-6 weeks of submission. I am waiting for my records at this time. I’ll be sure to provide an update of my experience with this service in the future.
