## Immunosuppression
It's not a foregone conclusion that individuals with immunosuppression are at higher risk for critical illness or death from Sars-CoV-2 infection. There are some who believe that immunosuppression may in fact prevent some of the severe lung injury that is the cause for respiratory failure in Covid-19.

[This article](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajt.15905) draws a connection between blood work, lung pathology, and disease outcomes. It's been known from early publications out of China that patients with Covid-19 often demonstrate lymphopenia. This is determined by one of the simplest, cheapest, and most ubiquitous tests that we send on almost every patient who comes to the hospital, a CBC (complete blood count). 

The lymphocyte is a type of white blood cell, and in Covid-19 patients, these are often found in lower amounts in the blood. One theory is that the lymphocytes are no longer in the blood stream because they've invaded damaged organs (such as the lungs). Autopsies and lung biopsies from patients with Covid-19 show lymphocytes infiltrating the lung tissue.

What's more, some case series have found that the more severe the lymphopenia, the more likely a patient will have respiratory failure, critical illness, or death<sup>[1]</sup>. Some immunosuppressive drugs may decrease the reactivity of the lymphocytes to viral infection. The virus can still damage the cells, but without the additional damage of the immune system, perhaps some patients escape secondary immune mediate damage. This is the basis for a theory of including immunosuppressant drugs on the list of things to consider for Covid-19.

The major downside to this idea is that it could open the patient to secondary infections. We have seen some studies show that patients with respiratory failure from Covid-19 may have a higher chance of becoming critically ill or dying if they have a coinfection - viral or bacterial. Corticosteroids, another class of drugs that are generally though of as immune suppressants have also been shown under certain circumstances to potentially worsen Covid-19 outcomes.
