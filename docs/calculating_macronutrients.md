# Two Ways to Calculate Your Macronutrient Ratios for a Quantified and Modifiable Approach to Nutrition
  
## Introduction

[Skip ahead to calculating macros.](#calculating-macronutrient-requirements)

How can we know what to eat? 

We can rely on intuition, but it has been well established, most thoroughly by [Stephan Guyenet, Ph.D](https://amzn.to/2ZUMGTT), that in the modern food environment, our intuition, our hunger and cravings, often give us the wrong answers.

Another approach is to try to understand [which substances the human body and mind requires to function and thrive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_of_the_human_body), and then to figure out how we get these substances from food.

The useful substances that we absorb when eating food, at base, are elements and molecules. Potassium is an element, [EPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eicosapentaenoic_acid) (a fat) is a molecule, lysine (an [amino-acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid)) is a molecule. The subset of elements and molecules obtained from diet that are required for our bodies and minds to grow and function properly are collectively called "nutrients." 

There are nearly limitless combinations of elements and molecules in our food, a multitude of nutrients, more than anybody can know about. So, in order to have any useful knowledge of nutrients, we need to categorize them; to simplify them.

One of the most useful methods of categorizing our food is by its energy content; and there are three major classes of biomolecules that contribute to the energy content of our food. These three classes are fat, protein, and carbohydrate. In nutrition, these 3 classes of biomolecules are commonly referred to as *the* [macronutrients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_macronutrients). There are other macronutrients, and there are also "micronutrients". All nutrients are important because they support one of the 3 needs of a living human: the structural elements, the functional moving parts, and the fuel.

### Structure
The structure of our body can be thought of as the framework, like the chassis of a car, the case of a watch, or the frame of a house.

We need building blocks to make the structure of the physical body - the hair, skin, muscles, bones, brain, nerves, vessels, and other organs.

In this category I place protein, fat, and minerals. Proteins are present in every cell as enzymes, channels, and signaling molecules, but structurally comprise much of the skin, hair, and muscles. Fats make up the cell membrane of every cell and insulate our nerves. Minerals such as calcium make up our [bones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone).

### Function - Moving Parts (or the mechanism)
I created this category, which, to my knowledge doesn't exist elsewhere in the nutrition world. If you find it somewhere else, let me know so I can give proper credit. If it doesn't make sense, you have only me to blame.

I think of this category as akin to the movement of a watch; the springs, levers, jewels, lubricant, and crown; or like the motor and transmission of a car; the pistons, cranks, fly-wheel, steering wheel, axles, gears, fans, coolant, and oil. 

These are not really the major structural elements of the machine, but they're substantial moving parts that give it function. These parts make the watch tick and make the car *drive* (which in the era of self driving cars, is a turn of phrase that actually makes sense).

In this category, I place electrolytes like potassium and magnesium, enzymes like pancreatic lipase or HMG-CoA Reductase which are proteins made of amino acids, metals like iron and copper, and vitamins like Vitamin A and D.

### Fuel (or energy)

We need fuel, or energy for the engine to run. Fuel is any form of stored energy that can be released. In the case of humans, we're quite similar to gas powered engines or fires - we break down hydrocarbons - fats and carbohydrates to release the energy stored in their bonds. The details of the process whereby this happens inside of human cells is different than what happens in a fire or inside of a gas powered car engine, but in essence it's the same.

The fuels are originally made by fusing atoms together - either under heated and pressurized conditions in the earth's crust in the case of fossil fuels, or by photosynthesis in the case of plant life, or by the work of animal metabolism. When the atoms and molecules in these fuels are broken down, when they're separated, they move around. This movement is tiny, but if you combine the movement of millions of such atoms into a tiny space and make them all move in the same way, the movement adds up to bigger and bigger movements - the up and down movement of a piston in the cylinder of a car engine, or the contraction and relaxation of the biceps muscle of a weight-lifter doing curls.

Unlike in a car where there is usually one motor and one fuel tank, or a watch where there is one movement and one spring, the human body can burn multiple types of fuel, has no central fuel tank, and has multiple tiny motors in each cell instead of one big motor.  The human body has a distributed fuel tank - each cell can store fuel, some cells store fuel as carbohydrate, some as fat, and some as both. Just like a car's fuel tank, the human fuel tank does have a limited, if expandable, capacity.

To fuel properly, we need to understand the types of fuel we can process, and in what amounts they're each needed. 

In this category are all three macronutrients - fats, protein, and carbohydrates.
  
All three needs (structure, function, and fuel) are important, but on a daily basis, it's primarily the fuel that needs to be replenished (unless fuel stores are over-flowing, in which case the primary nutrients that are needed are structural and functional elements). Of course, we need a constant intake of nutrients like calcium and electrolytes to keep our cells functioning properly, but if we eat a diverse whole-food diet with the proper quantities of macronutrients for our individual needs, we're likely to fulfill most of our other needs automatically.

You might be asking, why don't we just calculate total energy needs then? What reason is there to look at individual macronutrients?

## Here are a few reasons:

### Reason #1
We have [separate (though overlapping) pathways](http://biochemical-pathways.com/#/map/1) for absorbing, processing, storing, and utilizing each macronutrient, and thus different requirements for each.

#### Carbohydrates
For example, after being eaten, carbohydrates are broken down into sugars in the small bowel ([Holmes 1971](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1176254/)). These sugars are then directly absorbed across the bowel wall into the bloodstream, and can be immediately delivered and used by almost any cell of any organ. Excess carbohydrates are taken up by different cell types such as liver and muscle and stored as a conglomerate of sugar molecules, called glycogen. Excess sugar can also be stored in fat cells through a process called [de novo lipogenesis](https://bit.ly/3g5vO2j) which actually creates fatty acids by stringing together carbon molecules from sugar.

#### Fats
Fats, on the other hand, are absorbed into cells that line the bowel, packaged into little fat bubbles called chylomicrons, which are then absorbed into the lymphatic system before being dumped into the circulation, and then have to be delivered to cells using transfer enzymes and lipases. Before these fats can be used for energy, they often have to undergo further processes to break them down and shuttle them to the location where they can be used. If they're not used, they can be stored as lipid droplets in fat or muscle cells, or they can be sent back to the liver and stored or reprocessed there. Most of what I've learned about cholesterol and fat metabolism, I've learned directly from, or as a result of [Peter Attia's work](https://peterattiamd.com/the-straight-dope-on-cholesterol-part-ii/).

#### Proteins
Proteins (large molecules built from many amino acids) are broken down in the bowel into amino acids and absorbed as amino acids or strings of two or three amino acids called di- and tri-peptides. Once absorbed, amino acids can be shuttled to muscle cells to synthesize new muscle, incorporated into new enzymes, or broken down into their subparts - nitrogen and carbon skeletons. The nitrogenous component can be used in nitrogen containing compounds, or it can be excreted in urine, feces, and sweat as urea, uric acid, and creatinine. The carbon skeleton goes into the same metabolic pathways that use hydrocarbon molecules from carbohydrates and fat to generate energy. Excess carbon skeletons can be glucogenic. It can be converted into blood glucose (sugar) by the liver and released into the blood stream. Ultimately, the carbon is either stored as glycogen, fat, or it's burned for energy ([Pellett 1990](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/51/5/723/4695334)).

You can learn more about nutrient absorption [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/organ-systems/the-gastrointestinal-system/v/small-intestine-part-3-absorption).

### Reason #2
Each macronutrient tends to have different neurohormonal effects on satiety and [metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism), which means that a proper macronutrient balance should reduce excess hunger and therefore excess energy intake.

### Reason #3
Foods that predominate in each macronutrient class tend to be more or less dense in other nutrients that are important for structural or functional reasons. As a result, a proper intake of diverse foods from each macronutrient category makes it more likely that we'll have a nutritionally complete diet.

For example, foods that are mostly made out of fat, such as butter and oil are often relatively poor in most vitamins and minerals, but can be rich in fat soluble vitamins like D and E. Dairy, which, through processing can be either high or low fat, is rich in calcium. Most foods that are mostly carbohydrate are poor in fat soluble vitamins and calcium, but may be rich in other nutrients. Starchy vegetables like potatoes, for example, are rich in magnesium and potassium, which are hard to find in most foods that are primarily fat. There are exception, like liver, for example, which is high in fat and rich in vitamins and minerals. Foods that are predominantly protein like chicken breast are rich in vitamin B3, B6, and Choline, but relatively poor in most other micronutrients.

## *Specific* Nutritional Requirements are Not Necessarily Generalizable Across People or Within the Same Person Across Time
Before diving into the calculations, I want to say that I think it's important to calculate macronutrients on an individual basis, and repeatedly over time. People differ from one another in lean body mass, activity level, personal preferences, and food tolerance. The macronutrient amounts and ratios that work for one person may not work for another. Just because my protein intake is 100 grams daily, doesn't mean that will work for someone else or that it will work for me in 3 months from now. Avoiding dietary dogma is another discussion entirely. The best writing I've seen on the topic is by [Chris Masterjohn, PhD](https://chrismasterjohnphd.com/) in his article ["Against Dietary Dogmatism."](https://chrismasterjohnphd.com/blog/2011/08/17/against-dietary-dogmatis).

## Calculating Macronutrient Requirements

Now that we've discussed macronutrients and the reasons for calculating them, here are two ways to do it. 

The first method is to use a nutrition tacking app called Cronometer. The second method is to perform the calculations manually. 

I prefer the first method, which is to use the calculators built into [Cronometer.com](https://cronometer.com/) (there's a web app and a mobile app). I like this method because it's fast, simple, and once you calculate your macronutrient requirements, you can easily track your diet, your weight, and your lean body mass in the same app in order to check that your calculated macronutrient requirements are accurate (accurate in the sense that your outcomes are moving in the desired direction: e.g. weight loss or weight gain, increase in lean body mass, etc.).

### Information You Need

Before you do either method, you'll need 3 pieces of information: your body weight, your height, and your % body fat.

#### Body Weight
Obtain your body weight in pounds or kg from any accurate scale. If you don't have one, consider buying an "[impedence scale](https://amzn.to/39qvvg7) "which will also allow you to measure % body fat.

#### Measure your height in feet and inches, or cm.
  
#### Your Body Fat % 
You can obtain your [estimated body fat %](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_composition) using any of the following methods listed below (in order by price and accuracy - most expensive and accurate last). The sweet spot of convenience, price, and accuracy is probably to use an "[impedence scale](https://amzn.to/39qvvg7) ".

    - Method Number 1: Use the profile and ketogenic calculator in Cronometer. (Don't panic - it's designed for a ketogenic diet, but it can be used for any diet)
        1. I use this method because it's the easiest and most accurate individualized method that I'm aware of.
        2. Navigate to the website [Cronometer.com](https://cronometer.com/). It's possible to do the same thing from the mobile app, but my screenshots are from the website. It shouldn't be too hard to find the corresponding screens on the mobile app.
        3. Enter your sex, weight, height, and body fat % into Cronometer.
            1. Make sure the BMR is calculated.
            2. Select an activity level.
                1. Assuming your goal is to maintain or lose weight, my recommendation on this is to identify which activity level you think you do, and then step it down one.
            3. Here's what you should see (with your own data):
                1. ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fkmllc%2FAGIkTa5IFL.png?alt=media&token=a6a3d8f0-fd6c-413f-91d2-0405220f6ac8)
        4. Next, go to the "Targets" tab, which is at the top of the screen next to "Profile."
            1. For "Tracking carbohydrates as:" select "Net Carbs without Sugar Alcohols"
            2. For "Set macro targets using" select "Ketogenic Calculator"
                1. Yes, do this even if you have no interest in a ketogenic diet.
        5. Now you'll see a box that says "Your Keto Calculator"
            1. Here's what you should see at this point ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fkmllc%2FBaVOyf4DvT.png?alt=media&token=55d43693-e660-4890-91d6-781931d6bc54)
            2. Make the selections seen in the image (or whatever you'd like to choose).
                1. For "Select your Keto program..." choose "Custom"
                2. For "Grams of protein per kg of lean body mass", a good starting point is 1.5 for an active individual who exercises on a daily basis.
                3. This last box, Grams of non-fiber carbohydrates per day is the big decision.
                    1. Personally, I aim for 50 grams daily with the athletic bonus toggle turned on.
                    2. For the vast majority of people, I think 50-100 grams of non-fiber carbohydrate per day is likely adequate. It's enough to allow for liberal vegetable and fruit consumption, and even __some__ bread, pasta, and starches, but restrictive enough to prevent you from eating candy, processed foods, baked goods, soda, juice, and other foods with added sugar. For larger than average individuals, athletes, highly active people, or people who prefer a primarily plant based diet heavy in root vegetables and fruits, it may be necessary to push this to 200 or even 300 grams per day.
                    3. For people with very high activity levels - like endurance athletes, Crossfit athletes, or just someone with a very high level of activity throughout the day, a higher carbohydrate intake might be desirable. This is an individualized decision and might require some careful thought and experimentation.
                    4. For a rough idea of what you can eat with a daily allowance of 100 grams of carbohydrate:
                        1. You could have all of these foods in the following amounts:
                            1. 1/2 cup of white rice
                            2. 1 cup of blueberries
                            3. 1/4 cup of ice cream
                            4. 3 6-inch long carrots
                            5. A large tomato (3 inch diameter)
                            6. 1/2 cup of pecans
                            7. 1 large red bell pepper
                            8. 1.5 cups of broccoli
                            9. 2 tbsp of half and half
                            10. 1/2 cup of whole milk yogurt
                            11. 1/2 of a sweet potato (5 inches long and 2 inches wide)
                        2. Or:
                            1. 13 heads of romaine lettuce (626 g in weight each)
                        3. Or:
                            1. 3 snickers bars
                        4. Or:
                            1. 2.5 bags of potato chips ("grab bag" size)
                        5. Or:
                            1. 4 bananas
                        6. Or:
                            1. 2 cups of Ben & Jerry's Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough
                        7. Or:
                            1. 2 cups of granola
                        8. Or:
                            1. 5 slices of store bought white bread
                        9. Or:
                            1. 6 slices of whole wheat bread (homemade/bakery)
                    5. With these parameters set, Cronometer will automatically calculate your macronutrient targets.
        6. To see your calculated macronutrient targets, go to the "Diary."
            1. ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fkmllc%2FkigscS0Vw6.png?alt=media&token=63f850af-c909-47d5-874a-3cb839b4a614)
            2. See those wheels and bars at the bottom of the screen; let's zoom in:
                1. ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fkmllc%2F0p8iakb7aS.png?alt=media&token=9e5f4878-ec1e-44ae-9024-895c49d53b78)
                2. If you hover over any of those items in the web app, or click them in the mobile app, you'll get more information. 
                    1. Here are my personal macronutrient requirements:
                        1. Protein 90 g
                        2. Net Carbs 50 g
                        3. Fat 177.8 g
                    2. On the particular day in the image I consumed more protein than needed, hit my carb target nearly spot on, and I had significant room to go in my fat intake. You can see in the purple box I had 491 kcal (calories) left - this is the difference between my energy (in kcals or calories) consumed and burned.
            3. That's it, you now have targets for your daily macronutrient intake.
    - Method Number 2: Calculate your macronutrient requirements manually.
        1. This process is the same as above, but you'll have to do some of the calculations on your own.
        2. Repeat step 2 above "Measure your height in feet and inches, or cm."
        3. Calculate your TDEE (total daily energy expenditure)
            1. [Use this calculator](https://www.calculator.net/tdee-calculator.html)
                1. Expand the "+Settings" and select:
                    1. Katch-McArdle and enter your body fat %
                2. Example:
                    1. ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fkmllc%2FwMXwOnWLw4.png?alt=media&token=3a6efd23-c51b-4351-9e93-b1e76fc5ba55)
        4. Calculate your Lean Body Mass
            1. Do it manually (Recommended)
                1. [Convert your weight to Kg](https://www.google.com/search?q=lbs+to+kg&oq=lbs+to+kg&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l7.858j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
                2. Lean body mass = weight in kg * (1 - body fat %)
            2. OR [Use this calculator](https://www.calculator.net/lean-body-mass-calculator.html?ctype=standard&csex=m&cage=n&cheightfeet=5&cheightinch=5&cpound=158&cheightmeter=180&ckg=60&x=93&y=24)
                1. If you navigate to the link above, it'll start out populated with my personal data. You can see the system is calculating my body fat % at 24-30 depending on the equation used. I know that this is factually inaccurate by at least 10%. This is why I recommend measuring body fat % using one of the above methods, and then calculating lean body mass based on that number.
        5. Calculate protein requirement
            1. Daily protein requirement = 1.5 g/kg of lean body mass * lean body mass 
                1. Example for a lean body mass of 70 kg
                    1. "Protein: 1.5 g/kg/day * 70 kg * 1 day = 98 grams of protein"
                        1. "98 grams * 4 calories / gram = 392 calories from protein"
                            1. [This is how we know](https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400525/Data/Classics/ah74.pdf) the energy content of different foods and macronutrients.
        6. Determine remaining energy requirements after protein intake.
            1. TDEEE - Calories from protein = Remaining Energy Needs
                1. Example:
                    1. TDEE = 2300 kcal - 392 kcal from protein = 1908 remaining kcal
        7. Choose a daily carbohydrate intake
            1. See above: "For the vast majority of people, I think 50-100 grams of non-fiber carbohydrate per day is likely adequate. It's enough to allow for liberal vegetable and fruit consumption, and even __some__ bread, pasta, and starches, but restrictive enough to prevent you from eating candy, processed foods, baked goods, soda, juice, and other foods with added sugar. For larger than average individuals, athletes, highly active people, or people who prefer a primarily plant based diet heavy in root vegetables and fruits, it may be necessary to push this to 200 or even 300 grams per day."
        8. Calculate amount of energy from carbohydate:
            1. Example: Let's say we selected 100 grams of carbohydate in the prior step.
                1. Carbohydrate has 4 kcal of energy per gram on average
                2. 4 kcal/g * 100 grams of carbohydrate = 400 kcal
        9. Subtract energy from carbohydrate from remaining daily energy requirement
            1. Example:
                1. TDEE = 2300 kcal - 392 kcal from protein - 400 kcal from carbohydrate = 1508 kcal
        10. Calculate amount of fat required to meet the remainder of daily energy requirements:
            1. Example:
                1. Remaining energy requirements = 1508 kcal
                2. Amount of energy in fat is 9 kcal/g 
                3. 1508 kcal / 9 kcal/g = 167.5 grams of fat
        11. Review the results - we have made the following determinations:
            1. Total daily energy expenditure: 2300 kcal
            2. Protein requirement: 98 grams, which is 392 calories
            3. Carbohydrate requirement: 100 grams, which is 400 calories
            4. Fat requirement: 167.5 grams, which is 1508 calories
- Conclusion:
    - Now that we have these macronutrient requirements calculated, what are we going to do with them?
    - Test them out. I recommend using [Cronometer.com](https://cronometer.com/) to track your diet for short periods of time to check that you're on the path you want to be on.
    - Now that you have some rough idea of your macronutrient requirements, it's easier to make the necessary adjustments. You need some starting point or framework to start from, and this is it. These quantifications eliminate the tendency to over or underestimate your intake of one thing or another (e.g. total calories/energy intake, carbohydrate intake, protein intake, etc.).
    - While this is just one way to obtain some control over your nutrition. It's a time tested strategy that forms the basis of the nutrition plan for most athletes. It's also implicit (or sometimes explicit) in almost any marketed diet plan that you might be interested in trying (not that I'm recommending any of these) - zone, paleo, Atkin's, "low-carb high-fat," "keto," and so on and so forth.
    - Overall, this is another tool that you can use to gain control over your nutrition.
    - And lastly, if you don't feel like going through all of this work, it is possible to hire someone to do it for you. But, this is the easy part. The hard part is consistently eating with purpose every day.
